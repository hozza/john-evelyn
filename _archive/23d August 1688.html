<p>I left this noble place and conversation,
my lady having provided carriages to convey us
back in the same manner as we went, and a dinner being
prepared at Dunstable against our arrival. Northampton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
having been lately burned and re-edified, is now become
a town that for the beauty of the buildings, especially
the church and townhouse, may compare with the neatest
in Italy itself.</p>

<p>Dr. Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, wrote a very honest
and handsome letter to the Commissioners Ecclesiastical,
excusing himself from sitting any longer among them,
he by no means approving of their prosecuting the Clergy
who refused to read the Declaration for liberty of conscience,
in prejudice of the Church of England.</p>

<p>The Dutch make extraordinary preparations both at sea
and land, which with no small progress Popery makes
among us, puts us to many difficulties. The Popish Irish
soldiers commit many murders and insults; the whole
nation disaffected, and in apprehensions.</p>

<p>After long trials of the doctors to bring up the little
Prince of Wales by hand (so many of her Majesty's children
having died infants) not succeeding, a country
nurse, the wife of a tile maker, is taken to give it suck.</p>
