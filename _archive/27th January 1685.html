<p>I dined at Lord Sunderland's, being
invited to hear that celebrated voice of Mr. Pordage,
newly come from Rome; his singing was after the Vene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>tian
recitative, as masterly as could be, and with an excellent
voice both treble and bass; Dr. Walgrave
accompanied it with his <span class="small">THEORBO LUTE</span>, on which he performed
beyond imagination, and is doubtless one of the
greatest masters in Europe on that charming instrument.
Pordage is a priest, as Mr. Bernard Howard told me in
private.</p>

<p>There was in the room where we dined, and in his
bedchamber, those incomparable pieces of Columbus, a
Flagellation, the Grammar school, the Venus and Adonis
of Titian; and of Vandyke's that picture of the late Earl
of Digby (father of the Countess of Sunderland), and
Earl of Bedford, Sir Kenelm Digby, and two ladies of
incomparable performance; besides that of Moses and the
burning bush of Bassano, and several other pieces of the
best masters. A marble head of M.Â Brutus, etc.</p>
