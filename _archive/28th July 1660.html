<p>I heard his Majesty's speech in the
Lords' House, on passing the Bills of Tonnage and
Poundage; restoration of my Lord Ormond to his estate
in Ireland; concerning the commission of sewers, and
continuance of the excise. In the afternoon I saluted
my old friend, the Archbishop of Armagh, formerly of
Londonderry (Dr. Bramhall). He presented several Irish
divines to be promoted as Bishops in that kingdom, most
of the Bishops in the three kingdoms being now almost
worn out, and the Sees vacant.</p>
