<p>Going to wait on Mr.Â Waller,
I viewed St. Stephen's church; the building, though
Gothic, is full of carving; within it is beautiful, especially
the choir and winding stairs. The glass is well
painted, and the tapestry hung up this day about the
choir, representing the conversion of Constantine, was
exceedingly rich.</p>

<p>I went to that excellent engraver, Du Bosse, for his
instruction about some difficulties in perspective which
were delivered in his book.</p>

<p>I concluded this year in health, for which I gave solemn
thanks to Almighty God.<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_40_40">40</a></p>
