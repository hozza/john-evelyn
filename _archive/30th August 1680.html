<p>I went to visit a French gentleman,
one Monsieur Chardin, who having been thrice in the
East Indies, Persia, and other remote countries, came
hither in our return ships from those parts, and it being
reported that he was a very curious and knowing man,
I was desired by the Royal Society to salute him in their
name, and to invite him to honor them with his company.
Sir Joseph Hoskins and Sir Christopher Wren
accompanied me. We found him at his lodgings in his
eastern habit, a very handsome person, extremely affable,
a modest, well-bred man, not inclined to talk wonders.
He spoke Latin, and understood Greek, Arabic, and
Persian, from eleven years' travels in those parts,
whither he went in search of jewels, and was become
very rich. He seemed about 36 years of age. After
the usual civilities, we asked some account of the extraordinary
things he must have seen in traveling over
land to those places where few, if any, northern <a id="tn_png_160"></a><!--TN: Comma removed after "Europeans"-->Europeans

Bagdad, Nineveh, Persepolis, etc. He told us that the
things most worthy of our sight would be, the draughts
he had caused to be made of some noble ruins, etc.;
for that, besides his own little talent that way, he had
carried two good painters with him, to draw landscapes,
measure and design the remains of the palace which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Alexander burned in his frolic at Persepolis, with divers
temples, columns, relievos, and statues, yet extant,
which he affirmed to be sculpture far exceeding anything
he had observed either at Rome, in Greece, or in any
other part of the world where magnificence was in
estimation. He said there was an inscription in letters
not intelligible, though entire. He was sorry he could
not gratify the curiosity of the Society at present, his
things not being yet out of the ship; but would wait on
them with them on his return from Paris, whither he
was going the next day, but with intention to return
suddenly, and stay longer here, the persecution in
France not suffering Protestants, and he was one, to be quiet.</p>

<p>He told us that Nineveh was a vast city, now all buried
in her ruins, the inhabitants building on the subterranean
vaults, which were, as appeared, the first stories of the
old city, that there were frequently found huge vases of
fine earth, columns, and other antiquities; that the straw
which the Egyptians required of the Israelites, was not
to burn, or cover the rows of bricks as we use, but being
chopped small to mingle with the clay, which being dried
in the sun (for they bake not in the furnace) would else
cleave asunder; that in Persia are yet a race of Ignicol√¶,
who worship the sun and the fire as Gods; that the women
of Georgia and Mingrelia were universally, and
without any compare, the most beautiful creatures for
shape, features, and figure, in the world, and therefore
the Grand Seignor and Bashaws had had from thence
most of their wives and concubines; that there had
within these hundred years been Amazons among them,
that is to say, a sort or race of valiant women, given to
war; that Persia was extremely fertile; he spoke also of
Japan and China, and of the many great errors of our
late geographers, as we suggested matter for discourse.
We then took our leave, failing of seeing his papers;
but it was told us by others that indeed he dared not open,
or show them, till he had first showed them to the French
King; but of this he himself said nothing.</p>
