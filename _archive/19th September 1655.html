<p>Came to see me Sir Edward
Hales, Mr. Ashmole, Mr. Harlakenton, and Mr. Thornhill:
and, the next day, I visited Sir Henry Newton at Charlton,
where I met the Earl of Winchelsea and Lady
Beauchamp, daughter to the Lord Capel.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon, I frequently staid at home to
catechize and instruct my family, those exercises universally
ceasing in the parish churches, so as people had no
principles, and grew very ignorant of even the common
points of Christianity; all devotion being now placed in
hearing sermons and discourses of speculative and national
things.</p>
