<p>Trinity Sunday, I passed at Rochester;
and, on the 5th, there was buried in the Cathedral Monsieur
Rabini√©re, Rear Admiral of the French squadron, a
gallant person, who died of the wounds he received in
the fight. This ceremony lay on me, which I performed
with all the decency I could, inviting the Mayor and
Aldermen to come in their formalities. Sir Jonas Atkins
was there with his guards; and the Dean and Prebendaries:
one of his countrymen pronouncing a funeral ora<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>tion
at the brink of his grave, which I caused to be dug
in the choir. This is more at large described in the
"Gazette" of that day; Colonel Reymes, my colleague in
commission, assisting, who was so kind as to accompany
me from London, though it was not his district; for
indeed the stress of both these wars lay more on me by
far than on any of my brethren, who had little to do in
theirs. I went to see Upnore Castle, which I found
pretty well defended, but of no great moment.</p>

<p>Next day I sailed to the fleet, now riding at the buoy
of the "Nore," where I met his Majesty, the Duke, Lord
Arlington, and all the great men, in the "Charles," lying
miserably shattered; but the miss of Lord Sandwich redoubled
the loss to me, and showed the folly of hazarding
so brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for
no provocation but that the Hollanders exceeded us in
industry, and in all things but envy.</p>

<p>At Sheerness, I gave his Majesty and his Royal Highness
an account of my charge, and returned to Queenborough;
next day dined at Major Dorel's, Governor of
Sheerness; thence, to Rochester; and the following day,
