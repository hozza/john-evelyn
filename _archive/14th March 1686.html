<p>The Bishop of Bath and Wells
preached on John vi. 17, a most excellent and pathetic
discourse: after he had recommended the duty of fasting
and other penitential duties, he exhorted to constancy in
the Protestant religion, detestation of the unheard-of
cruelties of the French, and stirring up to a liberal contribution.
This sermon was the more acceptable, as it
was unexpected from a Bishop who had undergone the
censure of being inclined to Popery, the contrary whereof
no man could show more. This indeed did all our
Bishops, to the disabusing and reproach of all their delators:
for none were more zealous against Popery than
they were.</p>
