gentlemen, or princes. It consisted of <a id="tn_png_271"></a><!--TN: "minatures" changed to "miniatures"-->miniatures, drawings,
shells, insects, medals, natural things, animals (of
which divers, I think 100, were kept in glasses of spirits
of wine), minerals, precious stones, vessels, curiosities in
amber, crystal, agate, etc.; all being very perfect and rare

and shells, drawn and <a id="tn_png_271a"></a><!--TN: "minatured" changed to "miniatured"-->miniatured to the life. He told us
that one book stood him in £300; it was painted by
that excellent workman, whom the late Gaston, Duke of
Orleans, employed. This gentleman's whole collection,
gathered by himself, traveling over most parts of Europe,
is estimated at £8,000. He appeared to be a modest and
obliging person.<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_62_62">62</a></p>
