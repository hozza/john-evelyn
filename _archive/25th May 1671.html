<p>I dined at a feast made for me and
my wife by the Trinity Company, for our passing a fine
of the land which Sir R.Â Browne, my wife's father,
freely gave to found and build their college, or almshouses
on, at Deptford, it being my wife's after her
father's decease. It was a good and charitable work and
gift, but would have been better bestowed on the poor
of that parish, than on the seamen's widows, the Trinity
Company being very rich, and the rest of the poor of
the parish exceedingly indigent.</p>
