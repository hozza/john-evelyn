<p>She was, accordingly, carried
to Godolphin, in Cornwall, in a hearse with six horses,
attended by two coaches of as many, with about thirty
of her relations and servants. There accompanied the
hearse her husband's brother, Sir William, two more of
his brothers, and three sisters; her husband was so overcome
with grief, that he was wholly unfit to travel so
long a journey, till he was more composed. I went as
far as Hounslow with a sad heart; but was obliged to
return upon some indispensable affairs. The corpse was
ordered to be taken out of the hearse every night, and
decently placed in the house, with tapers about it, and
her servants attending, to Cornwall; and then was honorably
interred in the parish church of Godolphin. This
funeral cost not much less than Â£1,000.</p>

<p>With Mr. Godolphin, I looked over and sorted his
lady's papers, most of which consisted of Prayers, Meditations,
Sermon-notes, Discourses, and Collections on
several religious subjects, and many of her own happy
composing, and so pertinently digested, as if she had been
all her life a student in divinity. We found a diary of
her solemn resolutions, tending to practical virtue, with
letters from select friends, all put into exact method.
It astonished us to see what she had read and written,
her youth considered.</p>
