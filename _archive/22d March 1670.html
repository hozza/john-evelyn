<p>I went to Westminster, where in the
House of Lords I saw his Majesty sit on his throne, but
without his robes, all the peers sitting with their hats

Lord Ross. Such an occasion and sight had not been
seen in England since the time of Henry VIII.<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17_17">17</a></p>
