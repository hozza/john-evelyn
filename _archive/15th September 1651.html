<p>I accompanied Sir Richard
Browne, my father-in-law, to the French Court, when he
had a favorable audience of the French King, and the
Queen, his mother; congratulating the one on his coming
to the exercise of his royal charge, and the other's prudent
and happy administration during her late regency,
desiring both to preserve the same amity for his master,
our King, as they had hitherto done, which they both
promised, with many civil expressions and words of
course upon such occasions. We were accompanied both
going and returning by the Introductor of Ambassadors
and Aid of Ceremonies. I also saw the audience of
Morosini, the Ambassador of Venice, and divers other Ministers
of State from German Princes, Savoy, etc. Afterward
I took a walk in the King's gardens, where I observed
that the mall goes the whole square there of next the
wall, and bends with an angle so made as to glance the
wall; the angle is of stone. There is a basin at the end
of the garden fed by a noble fountain and high jetto.
There were in it two or three boats, in which the King
now and then rows about. In another part is a complete
fort, made with bastions, graft, half-moons, ravelins,
and furnished with great guns cast on purpose to instruct
the King in fortification.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>
