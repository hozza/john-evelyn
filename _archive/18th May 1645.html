<p>I intended to have seen Loretto, but,
being disappointed of moneys long expected, I was forced
to return by the same way I came, desiring, if possible,
to be at Venice by the Ascension, and therefore I diverted
to take Leghorn in the way, as well to furnish
me with credit by a merchant there, as to take order for
transporting such collections as I had made at Rome.
When on my way, turning about to behold this once and
yet glorious city, from an eminence, I did not, without
some regret, give it my last farewell.</p>

<p>Having taken leave of our friends at Rome, where I
had sojourned now about seven months, autumn, winter,
and spring, I took coach, in company with two courteous
Italian gentlemen. In the afternoon, we arrived at a
house, or rather castle, belonging to the Duke of Parma,
called Caprarola, situate on the brow of a hill, that overlooks
a little town, or rather a natural and stupendous
rock; witness those vast caves serving now for cellarage,
where we were entertained with most generous wine of sev<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>eral
sorts, being just under the foundation. The palace
was built by the famous architect, Vignola, at the cost
of Cardinal Alex. Farnese, in form of an octagon, the
court in the middle being exactly round, so as rather
to resemble a fort, or castle; yet the chambers within
are all of them square, which makes the walls exceedingly
thick. One of these rooms is so artificially contrived,
that from the two opposite angles may be heard
the least whisper; they say any perfect square does it.
Most of the paintings are by Zuccari. It has a stately
entry, on which spouts an artificial fountain within the
porch. The hall, chapel, and a great number of lodging
chambers are remarkable; but most of all the pictures
and witty inventions of Hannibal Caracci; the Dead
Christ is incomparable. Behind are the gardens full of
statues and noble fountains, especially that of the Shepherds.
After dinner, we took horse, and lay that night
at Monte Rossi, twenty miles from Rome.</p>
