<p>I returned to town in a coach with
the Earl of Clarendon, when passing by the glorious
palace of his father, built but a few years before, which
they were now demolishing, being sold to certain undertakers,
I turned my head the contrary way till the coach
had gone past it, lest I might minister occasion of speaking
of it; which must needs have grieved him, that in so
short a time their pomp was fallen.</p>
