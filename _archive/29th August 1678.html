<p>I was called to London to wait
upon the Duke of Norfolk, who having at my sole request
bestowed the Arundelian Library on the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Society; sent to me to take charge of the books, and remove
them, only stipulating that I would suffer the
Herald's chief officer, Sir William Dugdale, to have such
of them as concerned heraldry and the marshal's office,
books of armory and genealogies, the Duke being Earl
Marshal of England. I procured for our Society, besides
printed books, near one hundred MSS. some in Greek of
great concernment. The printed books being of the oldest
impressions, are not the less valuable; I esteem them
almost equal to MSS. Among them, are most of the
Fathers, printed at Basil, before the Jesuits abused them
with their expurgatory Indexes; there is a noble MS. of
Vitruvius. Many of these books had been presented by
Popes, Cardinals, and great persons, to the Earls of Arundel
and Dukes of Norfolk; and the late magnificent Earl
of Arundel bought a noble library in Germany, which is
in this collection. I should not, for the honor I bear the
family, have persuaded the Duke to part with these, had
I not seen how negligent he was of them, suffering the
priests and everybody to carry away and dispose of what
they pleased; so that abundance of rare things are irrecoverably
gone.</p>

<p>Having taken order here, I went to the Royal Society
to give them an account of what I had procured, that
they might call a Council and appoint a day to wait on
the Duke to thank him for this munificent gift.</p>
