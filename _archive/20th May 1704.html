<p>Most extravagant expense to debauch
and corrupt votes for Parliament members. I sent my
grandson with his party of my freeholders to vote for
Mr. Harvey, of Combe.</p>

<p>4th January, 1704-05. I dined at Lambeth with the
Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. King, a sharp and ready man
in politics, as well as very learned.</p>

<p>June, 1705. The season very dry and hot. I went
to see Dr. Dickinson the famous chemist. We had long
conversation about the philosopher's elixir, which he believed
attainable, and had seen projection himself by one
who went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes
came along among the adepts, but was unknown as to
his country, or abode; of this the doctor had written a
treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations. He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St. John's
College, Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but
has now altogether given it over, and lives retired, being
very old and infirm, yet continuing chemistry.</p>

<p>I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began
to take in wounded and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly
well provided for. The buildings now going
on are very magnificent.</p>

<p>October, 1705. Mr. Cowper made Lord Keeper. Observing
how uncertain great officers are of continuing
long in their places, he would not accept it, unless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
£2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice. His predecessors,
how little time soever they had the Seal, usually
got £100,000 and made themselves Barons. A new Secretary
of State. Lord Abington, Lieutenant of the Tower,
displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in. An indication of great unsteadiness
somewhere, but thus the crafty Whig party (as
called) begin to change the face of the Court, in opposition
to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen. The Parliament
chose one Mr. Smith, Speaker. There had never
been so great an assembly of members on the first day
of sitting, being more than 450. The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen,
contrary to all expectation.</p>
