<p>I went to visit my Lord Crofts,
now dying at St. Edmunds Bury, and took the opportunity
to see this ancient town, and the remains of that
famous monastery and abbey. There is little standing
entire, save the gatehouse; it has been a vast and magnificent
Gothic structure, and of great extent. The gates
are wood, but quite plated over with iron. There are
also two stately churches, one especially.</p>
