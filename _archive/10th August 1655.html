<p>To Albury, to visit Mr. Howard,
who had begun to build, and alter the gardens much.
He showed me many rare pictures, particularly the Moor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
on horseback; Erasmus, as big as the life, by Holbein; a
Madonna, in miniature, by Oliver; but, above all, the skull,
carved in wood, by Albert Durer, for which his father was
offered £100; also Albert's head, by himself, with divers
rare agates, intaglios, and other curiosities.</p>
