<p>I saw the chirurgeon cut off the
leg of a wounded sailor, the stout and gallant man enduring
it with incredible patience, without being bound
to his chair, as usual on such painful occasions. I had
hardly courage enough to be present. Not being cut off
high enough the gangrene prevailed, and the second
operation cost the poor creature his life.</p>

<p>Lord! what miseries are mortal men subject to, and
what confusion and mischief do the avarice, anger, and
ambition of Princes, cause in the world!</p>
