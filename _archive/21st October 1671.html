<p>Quitting Euston, I lodged this
night at Newmarket, where I found the jolly blades racing,
dancing, feasting, and reveling; more resembling a
luxurious and abandoned rout, than a Christian Court.
The Duke of Buckingham was now in mighty favor, and
had with him that impudent woman, the Countess of
Shrewsbury, with his band of fiddlers, etc.</p>

<p>Next morning, in company with Sir Bernard Gascoyne,
and Lord Hawley, I came in the Treasurer's coach to
Bishop Stortford, where he gave us a noble supper. The
following day, to London, and so home.</p>
