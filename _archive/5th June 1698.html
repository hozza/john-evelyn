<p>Dr. White, late Bishop of Norwich,
who had been ejected for not complying with Government,
was buried in St. Gregory's churchyard, or vault,
at St. Paul's. His hearse was accompanied by two non-juror
bishops, Dr. Turner of Ely, and Dr. Lloyd, with
forty other non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the
Office of the burial, because the Dean of St. Paul's had
appointed a conforming minister to read the Office; at
which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.</p>
