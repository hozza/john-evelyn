<p>A trial in the Common Pleas between
the Lady Purbeck Temple and Mr. Temple, a nephew of
Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up to take place of
several wills. This deed was proved to be forged. The
cause went on my lady's side. This concerning my son-in-law,
Draper, I stayed almost all day at Court. A great
supper was given to the jury, being persons of the best
condition in Buckinghamshire.</p>
