<p>I carried Lady Tuke to thank the
Countess of Arlington for speaking to his Majesty in her
behalf, for being one of the Queen Consort's women.
She carried us up into her new dressing room at Goring
House, where was a bed, two glasses, silver jars, and
vases, cabinets, and other so rich furniture as I had
seldom seen; to this excess of superfluity were we now
arrived and that not only at Court, but almost universally,
even to wantonness and profusion.</p>

<p>Dr. Compton, brother to the Earl of Northampton,
preached on 1 Corinth. v. 11-16, showing the Church's
power in ordaining things indifferent; this worthy person's
talent is not preaching, but he is likely to make a
grave and serious good man.</p>

<p>I saw her Majesty's rich toilet in her dressing room,
being all of massy gold, presented to her by the King,
valued at Â£4,000.</p>
