<p>Very cold weather. Sir Purbeck
Temple, uncle to my son Draper, died suddenly. A great
funeral at Addiscombe. His lady being own aunt to my
son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir. There had been a new meeting of the commissioners
about Greenwich hospital, on the new commission,
where the Lord Mayor, etc. appeared, but I was prevented
by indisposition from attending. The weather very sharp,
winter approaching apace. The King went a progress into
the north, to show himself to the people against the
elections, and was everywhere complimented, except at
Oxford, where it was not as he expected, so that he
hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed. I dined
with Dr. Gale at St. Paul's school, who showed me many
curious passages out of some ancient Platonists' MSS.
concerning the Trinity, which this great and learned
person would publish, with many other rare things, if he
was encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.</p>
