<p>Mr. Pepys read to me his Remonstrance,
showing with what malice and injustice he was
suspected with Sir Anthony Deane about the timber, of
which the thirty ships were built by a late Act of Parliament,
with the exceeding danger which the fleet would
shortly be in, by reason of the tyranny and incompetency
of those who now managed the Admiralty and affairs of
the Navy, of which he gave an accurate state, and showed
his great ability.</p>
