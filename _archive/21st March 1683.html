<p>Dr. Tenison preached at Whitehall
on 1 Cor. vi. 12; I esteem him to be one of the most
profitable preachers in the Church of England, being also
of a most holy conversation, very learned and ingenious.
The pains he takes and care of his parish will, I fear,
wear him out, which would be an inexpressible loss.</p>
