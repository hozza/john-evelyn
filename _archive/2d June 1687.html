<p>I went to London, it having pleased
his Majesty to grant me a Privy Seal for £6,000, for
discharge of the debt I had been so many years persecuted
for, it being indeed for money drawn over by my
father-in-law, Sir R. Browne, during his residence in the
Court of France, and so with a much greater sum due
to Sir Richard from his Majesty; and now this part of
the arrear being paid, there remains yet due to me, as
executor of Sir Richard, above £6,500 more; but this
determining an expensive Chancery suit has been so great
a mercy and providence to me (through the kindness
and friendship to me of Lord Godolphin, one of the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury,) that I do acknowledge
it with all imaginable thanks to my gracious
God.</p>
