<p>I went to hear the music of the
Italians in the new chapel, now first opened publicly at
Whitehall for the Popish Service. Nothing can be finer
than the magnificent marble work and architecture at the
end, where are four statues, representing St. John, St.
Peter, St. Paul, and the Church, in white marble, the
work of Mr. Gibbons, with all the carving and pillars of
exquisite art and great cost. The altar piece is the Salutation;
the volto in <i>fresco</i>, the Assumption of the blessed
Virgin, according to their tradition, with our blessed
Savior, and a world of figures painted by Verrio. The
throne where the King and Queen sit is very glorious, in
a closet above, just opposite to the altar. Here we saw
the Bishop in his mitre and rich copes, with six or seven
Jesuits and others in rich copes, sumptuously habited,
often taking off and putting on the Bishop's mitre, who
sat in a chair with arms pontifically, was adored and
censed by three Jesuits in their copes; then he went to
the altar and made divers cringes, then censing the images
and glorious tabernacle placed on the altar, and now
and then changing place: the crosier, which was of silver,
was put into his hand with a world of mysterious ceremony,
the music playing, with singing. I could not have
believed I should ever have seen such things in the King
of England's palace, after it had pleased God to enlighten
this nation; but our great sin has, for the present, eclipsed
the blessing, which I hope he will in mercy and his good
time restore to its purity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>Little appearance of any winter as yet.</p>

<p>1st January, 1686-87. Mr. Wake preached at St. Martin's
on 1 Tim. iii. 16, concerning the mystery of godliness.
He wrote excellently, in answer to the Bishop
of Meaux.</p>
