<p>We pass the Humber, an arm of
the sea of about two leagues breadth. The weather was
bad, but we crossed it in a good barge to Barton, the
first town in that part of Lincolnshire. All marsh ground
till we came to Brigg, famous for the plantations of
licorice, and then had brave pleasant riding to <span class="sidenote">LINCOLN</span>Lincoln,
much resembling Salisbury Plain. Lincoln is an old confused
town, very long, uneven, steep, and ragged; formerly
full of good houses, especially churches and abbeys.
The Minster almost comparable to that of York
itself, abounding with marble pillars, and having a fair
front (herein was interred Queen Eleanora, the loyal
and loving wife who sucked the poison out of her
husband's wound); the abbot founder, with rare carving
in the stone; the great bell, or Tom, as they call it. I
went up the steeple, from whence is a goodly prospect
all over the country. The soldiers had lately knocked
off most of the brasses from the gravestones, so as few
inscriptions were left; they told us that these men went
in with axes and hammers, and shut themselves in, till
they had rent and torn off some barge loads of metal,
not sparing even the monuments of the dead; so hellish
an avarice possessed them: beside which, they exceedingly
ruined the city.</p>

<p>Here, I saw a tall woman six feet two inches high,
comely, middle-aged, and well-proportioned, who kept a
very neat and clean alehouse, and got most by people's
coming to see her on account of her height.</p>
