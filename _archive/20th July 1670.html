<p>We went to dine at Lord Allington's,
who had newly built a house of great cost, I believe a
little less than Â£20,000. His architect was Mr. Pratt. It
is seated in a park, with a sweet prospect and stately
avenue; but water still defective; the house has also its
infirmities. Went back to Mr. Slingsby's.</p>
