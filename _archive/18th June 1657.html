<p>At Greenwich I saw a sort of cat<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_57_57">57</a>
brought from the East Indies, shaped and snouted much
like the Egyptian racoon, in the body like a monkey,
and so footed; the ears and tail like a cat, only the tail
much longer, and the skin variously ringed with black
and white; with the tail it wound up its body like a
serpent, and so got up into trees, and with it would wrap
its whole body round. Its hair was woolly like a lamb;
it was exceedingly nimble, gentle, and purred as does the cat.</p>
