<p>I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer,
where was the victorious Duke of Marlborough, who
came to me and took me by the hand with extraordinary
familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to do,
without any alteration of his good-nature. He had a
most rich George in a sardonyx set with diamonds of
very great value; for the rest, very plain. I had not
seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.</p>
