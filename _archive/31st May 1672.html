<p>I received another command to repair
to the seaside; so I went to Rochester, where I found
many wounded, sick, and prisoners, newly put on shore
after the engagement on the 28th, in which the Earl of
Sandwich, that incomparable person and my particular
friend, and divers more whom I loved, were lost. My
Lord (who was Admiral of the Blue) was in the "Prince,"
which was burnt, one of the best men-of-war that ever
spread canvas on the sea. There were lost with this
brave man, a son of Sir Charles Cotterell (Master of the
Ceremonies), and a son of Sir Charles Harbord (his
Majesty's Surveyor-General), two valiant and most accomplished
youths, full of virtue and courage, who might
have saved themselves; but chose to perish with my
Lord, whom they honored and loved above their own
lives.</p>

<p>Here, I cannot but make some reflections on things
past. It was not above a day or two that going to
Whitehall to take leave of his Lordship, who had his
lodgings in the Privy-Garden, shaking me by the hand
he bid me good-by, and said he thought he would see
me no more, and I saw, to my thinking, something boding
in his countenance: "No," says he, "they will not
have me live. Had I lost a fleet (meaning on his return
from Bergen when he took the East India prize) I should
have fared better; but, be as it pleases Godâ€”I must do
something, I know not what, to save my reputation."
Something to this effect, he had hinted to me; thus I took
my leave. I well remember that the Duke of Albemarle,
and my now Lord Clifford, had, I know not why, no
great opinion of his courage, because, in former conflicts,
being an able and experienced seaman (which neither
of them were), he always brought off his Majesty's ships
without loss, though not without as many marks of true
courage as the stoutest of them; and I am a witness that,
in the late war, his own ship was pierced like a colander.
But the business was, he was utterly against this war
from the beginning, and abhorred the attacking of the
Smyrna fleet; he did not favor the heady expedition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Clifford at Bergen, nor was he so furious and confident
as was the Duke of Albemarle, who believed he could vanquish
the Hollanders with one squadron. My Lord Sandwich
was prudent as well as valiant, and always governed his
affairs with success and little loss; he was for deliberation
and reason, they for action and slaughter without
either; and for this, whispered as if my Lord Sandwich
was not so gallant, because he was not so rash, and knew
how fatal it was to lose a fleet, such as was that under
his conduct, and for which these very persons would
have censured him on the other side. This it was, I am
confident, grieved him, and made him enter like a lion,
and fight like one too, in the midst of the hottest service,
where the stoutest of the rest seeing him engaged, and so
many ships upon him, dared not, or would not, come to
his succor, as some of them, whom I know, might have
done. Thus, this gallant person perished, to gratify the
pride and envy of some I named.</p>

<p>Deplorable was the loss of one of the best accomplished
persons, not only of this nation, but of any other. He
was learned in sea affairs, in politics, in mathematics, and
in music: he had been on divers embassies, was of a
sweet and obliging temper, sober, chaste, very ingenious,
a true nobleman, an ornament to the Court and his Prince;
nor has he left any behind him who approach his many
virtues.</p>

<p>He had, I confess, served the tyrant Cromwell, when a
young man, but it was without malice, as a soldier of fortune;
and he readily submitted, and that with joy, bringing
an entire fleet with him from the Sound, at the first
tidings of his Majesty's restoration. I verily believe him
as faithful a subject as any that were not his friends. I
am yet heartily grieved at this mighty loss, nor do I call
it to my thoughts without emotion.</p>
