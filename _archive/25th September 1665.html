<p>My Lord Admiral being come
from the fleet to Greenwich, I went thence with him to
the Cock-pit, to consult with the Duke of Albemarle. I
was peremptory that, unless we had Â£10,000 immediately,
the prisoners would starve, and it was proposed it should
be raised out of the East India prizes now taken by Lord
Sandwich. They being but two of the commission, and
so not empowered to determine, sent an express to his
Majesty and Council, to know what they should do. In
the meantime, I had five vessels, with competent guards,
to keep the prisoners in for the present, to be placed as
I should think best. After dinner (which was at the
General's) I went over to visit his Grace, the Archbishop
of Canterbury, at Lambeth.</p>
