<p>We saw Dioclesian's Baths,
whose ruins testify the vastness of the original foundation
and magnificence; by what M. Angelo took from
the ornaments about it, 'tis said he restored the then
almost lost art of architecture. This monstrous pile was
built by the labor of the primitive Christians, then under
one of the ten great persecutions. The Church of St.
Bernardo is made out of one only of these ruinous cupolas,
and is in the form of an urn with a cover.</p>

<p>Opposite to this, is the Fontana delle Therme, otherwise
called <i>Fons Felix</i>; in it is a basso-relievo of white marble,
representing Moses striking the rock, which is adorned
with camels, men, women, and children drinking, as large
as life; a work for the design and vastness truly magnificent.
The water is conveyed no less than twenty-two
miles in an aqueduct by Sextus V., <i>ex agro Columna</i>, by
way of Præneste, as the inscription testifies. It gushes
into three ample lavers raised about with stone, before
which are placed two lions of a strange black stone, very
rare and antique. Near this are the store-houses for the
city's corn, and over against it the Church of St. Susanna,
where were the gardens of Sallust. The faciàta of this
church is noble, the <i>soffito</i> within gilded and full of
pictures; especially famous is that of Susanna, by Baldassa
di Bologna. The tribunal of the high altar is of exquisite
work, from whose marble steps you descend under ground
to the repository of divers Saints. The picture over this
altar is the work of Jacomo Siciliano. The foundation is
for Bernadine Nuns.</p>

<p>Santa Maria della Vittoria presents us with the most
ravishing front. In this church was sung the Te Deum by
Gregory XV., after the signal victory of the Emperor at
Prague; the standards then taken still hang up, and the
impress waving this motto over the Pope's arms, <i>Extir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>pentur</i>.
I observed that the high altar was much frequented
for an image of the Virgin. It has some rare
statues, as Paul ravished into the third heaven, by Fiamingo,
and some good pictures. From this, we bent
toward Dioclesian's Baths, never satisfied with contemplating
that immense pile, in building which 150,000 Christians
were destined to labor fourteen years, and were then
all murdered. Here is a monastery of Carthusians, called
Santa Maria degli Angeli, the architecture of M. Angelo,
and the cloister encompassing walls in an ample garden.</p>

<p>Mont Alto's villa is entered by a stately gate of stone
built on the Viminalis, and is no other than a spacious
park full of fountains, especially that which salutes us at
the front; stews for fish; the cypress walks are so beset
with statues, inscriptions, relievos, and other ancient
marbles, that nothing can be more stately and solemn.
The citron trees are uncommonly large. In the palace
joining to it are innumerable collections of value. Returning,
we stepped into St. Agnes church, where there is a
tribunal of antique mosaic, and on the altar a most rich
ciborio of brass, with a statue of St. Agnes in oriental
alabaster. The church of Santa Constanza has a noble
cupola. Here they showed us a stone ship borne on a
column heretofore sacred to Bacchus, as the relievo intimates
by the drunken emblems and instruments wrought
upon it. The altar is of rich porphyry, as I remember.
Looking back, we had the entire view of the Via Pia down
to the two horses before the Monte Cavallo, before mentioned,
one of the most glorious sights for state and
magnificence that any city can show a traveler. We returned
by Porta Pia, and the Via Salaria, near Campo
Scelerato, in whose gloomy caves the wanton Vestals were
heretofore immured alive.</p>

<p>Thence to Via Felix, a straight and noble street but
very precipitous, till we came to the four fountains of
Lepidus, built at the abutments of four stately ways,
making an exact cross of right angles; and, at the fountains,
are as many cumbent figures of marble, under very
large niches of stone, the water pouring into huge basins.
The church of St. Carlo is a singular fabric for neatness,
of an oval design, built of a new white stone; the columns
are worth notice. Under it is another church of a
structure nothing less admirable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Next, we came to Santa Maria Maggiore, built upon
the Esqueline Mountain, which gives it a most conspicuous
face to the street at a great distance. The design is
mixed partly antique, partly modern. Here they affirm
that the Blessed Virgin appearing, showed where it should
be built 300 years since. The first pavement is rare and
antique; so is the portico built by P. P. Eugenius II.
The <i>ciborio</i> is the work of Paris Romano, and the tribunal
of Mosaic.</p>

<p>We were showed in the church a <i>concha</i> of porphyry,
wherein they say Patricius, the founder, lies. This is one
of the most famous of the seven Roman Churches, and
is, in my opinion at least, after St. Peter's, the most magnificent.
Above all, for incomparable glory and materials,
are the two chapels of Sextus V. and Paulus V.
That of Sextus was designed by Dom. Fontana, in which
are two rare great statues, and some good pieces of
painting; and here they pretended to show some of the
Holy Innocents' bodies slain by Herod: as also that renowned
tabernacle of metal, gilt, sustained by four angels,
holding as many tapers, placed on the altar. In this
chapel is the statue of Sextus, in copper, with basso-relievos
of most of his famous acts, in Parian marble;
but that of P. Paulus, which we next entered, opposite to
this, is beyond all imagination glorious, and above description.
It is so encircled with agates, and other most
precious materials, as to dazzle and confound the beholders.
The basso-relievos are for the most part of pure
snowy marble, intermixed with figures of molten brass,
double gilt, on <i>lapis lazuli</i>. The altar is a most stupendous
piece; but most incomparable is the cupola painted
by Giuseppe Rheni, and the present Baglioni, full of exquisite
sculptures. There is a most sumptuous <i>sacristia</i>;
and the piece over the altar was by the hand of St.
Luke; if you will believe it. Paulus V. hath here likewise
built two other altars; under the one lie the bones of
the Apostle, St. Matthias. In another oratory, is the
statue of this Pope, and the head of the Congo Ambassador,
who was converted at Rome, and died here. In a
third chapel, designed by Michael Angelo, lie the bodies
of Platina, and the Cardinal of Toledo, Honorius III.,
Nicephorus IV., the ashes of St. Hierom, and many
others. In that of Sextus V., before mentioned, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
showed us part of the crib in which Christ was swaddled
at Bethlehem; there is also the statue of Pius V.; and
going out at the further end, is the resurrection of Lazarus,
by a very rare hand. In the portico, is this late
inscription: "<i>Cardinal Antonio Barberino Archypresbytero,
aream marmoream quam Christianorum pietas exsculpsit,
laborante sub Tyrannis ecclesiâ, ut esset loci sanctitate venerabilior,
Francis Gualdus Arm. Eques S. Stephani è suis
ædibus huc transtulit et ornavit, 1632</i>." Just before this
portico, stands a very sublime and stately Corinthian
column, of white marble, translated hither for an ornament
from the old Temple of Peace, built by Vespasian,
having on the plinth of the capital the image of our
Lady, gilt on metal; at the pedestal runs a fountain.
Going down the hill, we saw the obelisk taken from the
Mausoleum of Augustus, and erected in this place by
Domenico Fontana, with this epigraph: "<i>Sextus V. Pont.
Max. Obeliscum ex Egypto advectum, Augusti in Mausoleo
dicatum, eversum deinde et in plures confractum partes, in
via ad S. Rochum jacentem, in pristinam faciem restitutum
Salutiferæ Cruci feliciùs <a id="tn_png_139"></a><!--TN: "hicerigi" changed to "hic erigi"-->hic erigi jussit, anno MDLXXXVIII,
Pont. III</i>"; and so we came weary to our lodgings.</p>

<p>At the foot of this hill, is the church of St. Prudentia,
in which is a well, filled with the blood and bones of
several martyrs, but grated over with iron, and visited
by many devotees. Near this stands the church of her
sister, S. Praxedeis, much frequented for the same reason.
In a little obscure place, canceled in with iron work, is
the pillar, or stump, at which they relate our Blessed
Savior was scourged, being full of bloody spots, at which
the devout sex are always rubbing their chaplets, and convey
their kisses by a stick having a tassel on it. Here, besides a
noble statue of St. Peter, is the tomb of the famous Cardinal
Cajetan, an excellent piece; and here they hold that St.
Peter said his first mass at Rome, with the same altar
and the stone he kneeled on, he having been first lodged
in this house, as they compute about the forty-fourth
year of the Incarnation. They also show many relics, or
rather rags, of his mantle. St. Laurence in Panisperna
did next invite us, where that martyr was cruelly broiled
on the gridiron, there yet remaining. St. Bridget is
buried in this church under a stately monument. In the
front of the pile is the suffering of St. Laurence painted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
<i>á fresco</i> on the wall. The fabric is nothing but Gothic. On
the left is the Therma Novatii; and, on the right, Agrippina's
Lavacrum.</p>
