<p>Dr. Lamplugh preached at St. Martin's
the Holy Sacrament following, which I partook of,
upon obligation of the late Act of Parliament, enjoining
everybody in office, civil or military, under penalty of
Â£500, to receive it within one month before two authentic
witnesses; being engrossed on parchment, to be afterward
produced in the Court of Chancery, or some other Court
of Record; which I did at the Chancery bar, as being one
of the Council of Plantations and Trade; taking then also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the oath of allegiance and supremacy, signing the clause
in the said Act against Transubstantiation.</p>
