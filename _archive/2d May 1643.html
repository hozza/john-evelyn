<p>I went from Wotton to London, where
I saw the furious and zealous people demolish that stately
Cross in Cheapside.</p>

<p>On the 4th I returned, with no little regret, for the
confusion that threatened us. Resolving to possess myself
in some quiet, if it might be, in a time of so great
jealousy, I built by my brother's permission, a study,
made a fish-pond, an island, and some other solitudes
and retirements at Wotton; which gave the first occasion
of improving them to those waterworks and gardens which
afterward succeeded them, and became at that time the
most famous of England.</p>
