<p>Accompanied with some English
gentlemen, we took horse to see St. Germains-en-Laye,
a stately country house of the King, some five leagues
from Paris. By the way, we alighted at St. Cloud,
where, on an eminence near the river, the Archbishop of
Paris has a garden, for the house is not very <a id="tn_png_077"></a><!--TN: Period changed to comma after "considerable"-->considerable,
rarely watered and furnished with fountains, statues,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and groves; the walks are very fair; the fountain of
Laocoon is in a large square pool, throwing the water
near forty feet high, and having about it a multitude of
statues and basins, and is a surprising object. But nothing
is more esteemed than the cascade falling from the
great steps into the lowest and longest walk from the
Mount Parnassus, which consists of a grotto, or shell-house,
on the summit of the hill, wherein are divers
waterworks and contrivances to wet the spectators; this
is covered with a fair cupola, the walls painted with the
Muses, and statues placed thick about it, whereof some
are antique and good. In the upper walks are two perspectives,
seeming to enlarge the alleys, and in this
garden are many other ingenious contrivances. The
palace, as I said, is not extraordinary. The outer walls
only painted <i>à fresco</i>. In the court is a Volary, and the
statues of Charles IX., Henry III., IV., and Louis XIII.,
on horseback, mezzo-relievo'd in plaster. In the garden
is a small chapel; and under shelter is the figure of
Cleopatra, taken from the Belvidere original, with others.
From the terrace above is a tempest well painted; and
thence an excellent prospect toward Paris, the meadows,
and river.</p>

<p>At an inn in this village is a host who treats all the
great persons in princely lodgings for furniture and
plate, but they pay well for it, as I have done. Indeed,
the entertainment is very splendid, and not unreasonable,
considering the excellent manner of dressing their
meat, and of the service. Here are many debauches
and excessive revelings, as being out of all noise and
observance.</p>



<p>From hence, about a league further, we went to see
Cardinal Richelieu's villa, at Ruell. The house is small,
but fairly built, in form of a castle, moated round. The
offices are toward the road, and over against it are large
vineyards, walled in. But, though the house is not of
the greatest, the gardens about it are so magnificent,
that I doubt whether Italy has any exceeding it for all
rarities of pleasure. The garden nearest the pavilion
is a parterre, having in the midst divers noble brass
statues, perpetually spouting water into an ample basin,
with other figures of the same metal; but what is most
admirable is the vast inclosure, and variety of ground,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
in the large garden, containing vineyards, cornfields,
meadows, groves (whereof one is of perennial greens),
and walks of vast length, so accurately kept and cultivated,
that nothing can be more agreeable. On one of
these walks, within a square of tall trees, is a basilisk
of copper, which, managed by the fountaineer, casts water
near sixty feet high, and will of itself move round so
swiftly, that one can hardly escape wetting. This leads
to the Citronière, which is a noble conserve of all those
rarities; and at the end of it is the Arch of Constantine,
painted on a wall in oil, as large as the real one at
Rome, so well done, that even a man skilled in painting,
may mistake it for stone and sculpture. The sky
and hills, which seem to be between the arches, are so
natural, that swallows and other birds, thinking to fly
through, have dashed themselves against the wall. I
was infinitely taken with this agreeable cheat. At the
further part of this walk is that plentiful, though artificial
cascade, which rolls down a very steep declivity,
and over the marble steps and basins, with an astonishing
noise and fury; each basin hath a jetto in it, flowing
like sheets of transparent glass, especially that which
rises over the great shell of lead, from whence it glides
silently down a channel through the middle of a spacious
gravel walk, terminating in a grotto. Here are also
fountains that cast water to a great height, and large
ponds, two of which have islands for harbor of fowls, of
which there is store. One of these islands has a receptacle
for them built of vast pieces of rock, near fifty
feet high, grown over with moss, ivy, etc., shaded
at a competent distance with tall trees: in this rupellary
nidary do the fowl lay eggs, and breed. We then saw
a large and very rare grotto of shell-work, in the shape
of Satyrs, and other wild fancies: in the middle stands
a marble table, on which a fountain plays in divers
forms of glasses, cups, crosses, fans, crowns, etc. Then
the fountaineer represented a shower of rain from the
top, met by small jets from below. At going out, two
extravagant musketeers shot us with a stream of water
from their musket barrels. Before this grotto is a long
pool into which ran divers spouts of water from leaden
escalop basins. <span class="sidenote">ST. GERMAINS</span>The viewing this paradise made us late

<p>The first building of this palace is of Charles V., called
the Sage; but Francis I. (that true virtuoso) made it complete;
speaking as to the style of magnificence then in
fashion, which was with too great a mixture of the Gothic,
as may be seen in what there is remaining of his in the
old Castle, an irregular piece as built on the old foundation,
and having a moat about it. It has yet some spacious
and handsome rooms of state, and a chapel neatly painted.
The new Castle is at some distance, divided from this by
a court, of a lower, but more modern design, built by
Henry IV. To this belong six terraces, built of brick and
stone, descending in cascades toward the river, cut out of
the natural hill, having under them goodly vaulted galleries;
of these, four have subterranean grots and rocks,
where are represented several objects in the manner of
scenes and other motions, by force of water, shown by the
light of torches only; among these, is Orpheus with his
music; and the animals, which dance after his harp; in the
second, is the King and Dolphin;<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17_17">17</a> in the third, is Neptune
sounding his trumpet, his chariot drawn by sea
horses; in the fourth, the story of Perseus and Andromeda;
mills; hermitages; men fishing; birds chirping; and many
other devices. There is also a dry grot to refresh in; all
having a fine prospect toward the river, and the goodly
country about it, especially the forest. At the bottom, is
a parterre; the upper terrace nearly half a mile in length,
with double declivities, arched and balustered with stone,
of vast and royal cost.</p>

<p>In the pavilion of the new Castle are many fair rooms,
well painted, and leading into a very noble garden and
park, where is a pall-mall, in the midst of which, on one
of the sides, is a chapel, with stone cupola, though small,
yet of a handsome order of architecture. Out of the park
you go into the forest, which being very large, is stored
with deer, wild boars, wolves, and other wild game. The
Tennis Court, and Cavallerizzo, for the menaged horses,
are also observable.</p>

<p>We returned to Paris by Madrid, another villa of the
King's, built by Francis I., and called by that name to
absolve him of his oath that he would not go from Madrid
(in which he was prisoner), in Spain, but from whence
he made his escape. This house is also built in a park,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and walled in. We next called in at the Bonnes-hommes,
well situated, with a fair chapel and library.</p>
