<p>Being one of the Council of the
Royal Society, I was named to be of the committee
to wait on our new President, the Lord Chancellor, our
Secretary, Dr. Sloane, and Sir R.Â Southwell, last Vice-President,
carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name,
and took the oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation
for the improvement of natural knowledge. Then
his Lordship made a short compliment concerning the
honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would
be to promote so noble a design, and come himself among
us, as often as the attendance on the public would permit;
and so we took our leave.</p>
