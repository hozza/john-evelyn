<p>As the turn came about, we were
ordered to watch on a horn-work near our quarters, and
trail a pike, being the next morning relieved by a company
of French. This was our continual duty till the castle
was refortified, and all danger of quitting that station secured;
whence I went to see a Convent of Franciscan Friars,
not far from our quarters, where we found both the chapel
and refectory full, crowded with the goods of such poor
people as at the approach of the army had fled with them
thither for sanctuary. On the day following, I went to
view all the trenches, approaches, and mines, etc. of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
besiegers; and, in particular, I took special notice of the
wheel-bridge, which engine his Excellency had made to
run over the moat when they stormed the castle; as it is
since described (with all the other particulars of this siege)
by the author of that incomparable work, "Hollandia Illustrata."
The walls and ramparts of earth, which a mine had
broken and crumbled, were of prodigious thickness.</p>

<p>Upon the 8th of August, I dined in the horse-quarters
with Sir Robert Stone and his lady, Sir William Stradling,
and divers Cavaliers; where there was very good cheer, but
hot service for a young drinker, as then I was; so that, being
pretty well satisfied with the confusion of armies and
sieges (if such that of the United Provinces may be called,
where their quarters and encampments are so admirably
regular, and orders so exactly observed, as few cities, the
best governed in time of peace, exceed it for all conveniences),
I took my leave of the Leagure and Camerades;
and, on the 12th of August, I embarked on the
"Waal," in company with three grave divines, who entertained
us a great part of our passage with a long dispute
concerning the lawfulness of church-music. We now
sailed by Teil, where we landed some of our freight;
and about five o'clock we touched at a pretty town named
Bommell, that had divers English in garrison. It stands
upon Contribution-land, which subjects the environs to the
Spanish incursions. We sailed also by an exceeding strong
fort called Lovestein, famous for the escape of the learned
Hugo Grotius, who, being in durance as a capital offender,
as was the unhappy Barneveldt, by the stratagem of his
lady, was conveyed in a trunk supposed to be filled with
books only. We lay at Gorcum, a very strong and considerable
frontier.</p>
