<p>Dr. Jeffryes, the minister of Althorpe,
who was my Lord's chaplain when ambassador in
France, preached the shortest discourse I ever heard;
but what was defective in the amplitude of his sermon,
he had supplied in the largeness and convenience of the
parsonage house, which the doctor (who had at least
£600 a year in spiritual advancement) had newly built,
and made fit for a person of quality to live in, with
gardens and all accommodation according therewith.</p>

<p>My lady carried us to see Lord Northampton's Seat, a
very strong, large house, built with stone, not altogether
modern. They were enlarging the garden, in which was
nothing extraordinary, except the iron gate opening into
the park, which indeed was very good work, wrought in
flowers painted with blue and gilded. There is a noble
walk of elms toward the front of the house by the
bowling green. I was not in any room of the house besides
a lobby looking into the garden, where my Lord
and his new Countess (Sir Stephen Fox's daughter, whom
I had known from a child) entertained the Countess and
her daughter the Countess of Arran (newly married to
the son of the Duke of Hamilton), with so little good
grace, and so dully, that our visit was very short, and so
we returned to Althorpe, twelve miles distant.</p>

<p>The house, or rather palace, at Althorpe, is a noble
uniform pile in form of a half H, built of brick and
freestone, balustered and <i>à la moderne</i>; the hall is well,
the staircase excellent; the rooms of state, galleries,
offices and furniture, such as may become a great prince.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
It is situated in the midst of a garden, exquisitely planted
and kept, and all this in a park walled in with hewn
stone, planted with rows and walks of trees, canals and
fish ponds, and stored with game. And, what is above
all this, governed by a lady, who without any show of
solicitude, keeps everything in such admirable order, both
within and without, from the garret to the cellar, that I
do not believe there is any in this nation, or in any
other, that exceeds her in such exact order, without
ostentation, but substantially great and noble. The meanest
servant is lodged so neat and cleanly; the service at
the several tables, the good order and decency—in a
word, the entire economy is perfectly becoming a wise
and noble person. She is one who for her distinguished
esteem of me from a long and worthy friendship, I must
ever honor and celebrate. I wish from my soul the Lord,
her husband (whose parts and abilities are otherwise
conspicuous), was as worthy of her, as by a fatal apostasy
and court-ambition he has made himself unworthy! This
is what she deplores, and it renders her as much affliction
as a lady of great soul and much prudence is capable of.
The Countess of Bristol, her mother, a grave and honorable
lady, has the comfort of seeing her daughter and
grandchildren under the same economy, especially Mr.
Charles Spencer, a youth of extraordinary hopes, very
learned for his age, and ingenious, and under a governor
of great worth. Happy were it, could as much be said
of the elder brother, the Lord Spencer, who, rambling
about the world, dishonors both his name and his family,
adding sorrow to sorrow to a mother, who has taken all
imaginable care of his education. There is a daughter
very young married to the Earl of Clancarty, who has a
great and fair estate in Ireland, but who yet gives no
great presage of worth,—so universally contaminated is
the youth of this corrupt and abandoned age! But this
is again recompensed by my Lord Arran, a sober and
worthy gentleman, who has espoused the Lady Ann Spencer,
a young lady of admirable accomplishments and
virtue.</p>
