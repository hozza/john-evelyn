<p>I dined at Lord John Berkeley's,
newly arrived out of Ireland, where he had been
Deputy; it was in his new house, or rather palace; for I
am assured it stood him in near Â£30,000. It was very
well built, and has many noble rooms, but they are not
very convenient, consisting but of one <i>Corps de Logis</i>;
they are all rooms of state, without closets. The staircase
is of cedar, the furniture is princely: the kitchen
and stables are ill placed, and the corridor worse, having
no report to the wings they join to. For the rest, the
fore-court is noble, so are the stables; and, above all,
the gardens, which are incomparable by reason of the
inequality of the ground, and a pretty piscina. The holly
hedges on the terrace I advised the planting of. The
porticos are in imitation of a house described by Palladio;
but it happens to be the worst in his book,
though my good friend, Mr. Hugh May, his Lordship's
architect, effected it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
