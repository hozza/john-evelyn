<p>Preached at Whitehall Dr. Burnet, late
Bishop of Sarum, on Heb. iv. 13, anatomically describing
the texture of the eye; and that, as it received such innumerable
sorts of spies through so very small a passage
to the brain, and that without the least confusion or
trouble, and accordingly judged and reflected on them; so
God who made this sensory, did with the greatest ease
and at once see all that was done through the vast universe,
even to the very thought as well as action. This
similitude he continued with much perspicuity and aptness;
and applied it accordingly, for the admonishing us
how uprightly we ought to live and behave ourselves
before such an all-seeing Deity; and how we were to conceive
of other his attributes, which we could have no
idea of than by comparing them by what we were able to
conceive of the nature and power of things, which were
the objects of our senses; and therefore it was that in
Scripture we attribute those actions and affections of God
by the same of man, not as adequately or in any proportion
like them, but as the only expedient to make some
resemblance of his divine perfections; as when the Scripture
says, "God will remember the sins of the penitent
no more:" not as if God could forget anything, but as
intimating he would pass by such penitents and receive
them to mercy.</p>

<p>I dined at the Bishop of St. Asaph's, Almoner to the
new Queen, with the famous lawyer Sir George Mackenzie
(late Lord Advocate of Scotland), against whom
both the Bishop and myself had written and published
books, but now most friendly reconciled.<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_73_73">73</a> He related to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
us many particulars of Scotland, the present sad condition
of it, the inveterate hatred which the Presbyterians
show to the family of the Stuarts, and the exceeding
tyranny of those bigots who acknowledge no superior on
earth, in civil or divine matters, maintaining that the
people only have the right of government; their implacable
hatred to the Episcopal Order and Church of England.
He observed that the first Presbyterian dissents
from our discipline were introduced by the Jesuits' order,
about the 20 of Queen Elizabeth, a famous Jesuit among
them feigning himself a Protestant, and who was the first
who began to pray extempore, and brought in that which
they since called, and are still so fond of, praying by
the Spirit. This Jesuit remained many years before he
was discovered, afterward died in Scotland, where he
was buried at ... having yet on his monument,
"<i>Rosa inter spinas</i>."</p>
