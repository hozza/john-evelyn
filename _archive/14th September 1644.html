<p>We took post for Richelieu,
passing by l'Isle Bouchard, a village in the way. The
next day, we arrived, and went to see the Cardinal's
Palace, near it. The town is built in a low, marshy
ground, having a narrow river cut by hand, very even
and straight, capable of bringing up a small vessel. It
consists of only one considerable street, the houses on
both sides (as indeed throughout the town) built exactly
uniform, after a modern handsome design. It has a
large goodly market house and place, opposite to which
is the church built of freestone, having two pyramids of
stone, which stand hollow from the towers. The church
is well built, and of a well-ordered architecture, within
handsomely paved and adorned. To this place belongs
an Academy, where, besides the exercise of the horse,
arms, dancing, etc., all the sciences are taught in the
vulgar French by professors stipendiated by the great Cardinal,
who by this, the cheap living there, and divers privileges,
not only designed the improvement of the vulgar
language, but to draw people and strangers to the town;
but since the Cardinal's death, it is thinly inhabited;
standing so much out of the way, and in a place not
well situated for health, or pleasure. He was allured to
build by the name of the place, and an old house there
belonging to his ancestors. This pretty town is handsomely
walled about and moated, with a kind of slight
fortification, two fair gates and drawbridges. Before
the gate, toward the palace, is a spacious circle, where
the fair is annually kept. About a flight-shot from the
town is the Cardinal's house, a princely pile, though on
an old design, not altogether Gothic, but mixed, and
environed by a clear moat. The rooms are stately, most
richly furnished with tissue, damask, arras, and velvet,
pictures, statues, vases, and all sorts of antiquities,
especially the Cæsars, in oriental alabaster. The long
gallery is painted with the famous acts of the Founder;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the roof with the life of Julius Cæsar; at the end of it
is a cupola, or singing theatre, supported by very stately
pillars of black marble. The chapel anciently belonged
to the family of the Founder. The court is very ample.
The gardens without are very large, and the parterres
of excellent embroidery, set with many statues of brass
and marble; the groves, meadows, and walks are a real
Paradise.</p>
