<p>My wife entertained her Majesty at
Deptford, for which the Queen gave me thanks in the
withdrawing room at Whitehall.</p>

<p>The University of Oxford presented me with the "<i>Marmora
Oxoniensia Arundeliana</i>"; the Bishop of Oxford
writing to desire that I would introduce Mr. Prideaux,
the editor (a young man most learned in antiquities) to
the Duke of Norfolk, to present another dedicated to his
Grace, which I did, and we dined with the Duke at
Arundel House, and supped at the Bishop of Rochester's
with Isaac Vossius.</p>
