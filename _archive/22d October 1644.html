<p>From Livorno, I took coach to
Empoly, where we lay, and the next day arrived at
Florence, being recommended to the house of Signor
Baritiére, in the Piazza del Spirito Santo, where we were
exceedingly well treated. Florence is at the foot of the
Apennines, the west part full of stately groves and
pleasant meadows, beautified with more than a thousand
houses and country palaces of note, belonging to gentlemen
of the town. The river Arno runs through the
city, in a broad, but very shallow channel, dividing it, as
it were, in the middle, and over it are four most sumptuous
bridges of stone. On that nearest to our quarter
are the four Seasons, in white marble; on another are
the goldsmiths' shops; at the head of the former stands
a column of ophite, upon which a statue of Justice, with
her balance and sword, cut out of porphyry, and the
more remarkable for being the first which had been
carved out of that hard material, and brought to perfection,
after the art had been utterly lost; they say this
was done by hardening the tools in the juice of certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
herbs. This statue was erected in that corner, because
there Cosmo was first saluted with the news of Sienna
being taken.</p>

<p>Near this is the famous Palazzo di Strozzi, a princely
piece of architecture, in a rustic manner. The Palace of
Pitti was built by that family, but of late greatly beautified
by Cosmo with huge square stones of the Doric,
Ionic, and the Corinthian orders, with a terrace at each
side having rustic uncut balustrades, with a fountain that
ends in a cascade seen from the great gate, and so forming
a vista to the gardens. Nothing is more admirable
than the vacant staircase, marbles, statues, urns, pictures,
court, grotto, and waterworks. In the quadrangle is a
huge jetto of water in a volto of four faces, with noble
statues at each square, especially the Diana of porphyry
above the grotto. We were here shown a prodigious
great loadstone.</p>

<p>The garden has every variety, hills, dales, rocks, groves,
aviaries, vivaries, fountains, especially one of five jettos,
the middle basin being one of the longest stones I ever
saw. Here is everything to make such a Paradise delightful.
In the garden I saw a rose grafted on an orange
tree. There was much topiary-work, and columns in
architecture about the hedges. The Duke has added an
ample laboratory, over against which stands a fort on a
hill, where they told us his treasure is kept. In this
Palace the Duke ordinarily resides, living with his Swiss
guards, after the frugal Italian way, and even selling
what he can spare of his wines, at the cellar under his
very house, wicker bottles dangling over even the chief
entrance into the palace, serving for a vintner's bush.</p>

<p>In the Church of Santo Spirito the altar and reliquary
are most rich, and full of precious stones; there are four
pillars of a kind of serpentine, and some of blue. Hence
we went to another Palace of the Duke's, called Palazzo
Vecchio, before which is a statue of David, by Michael
Angelo, and one of Hercules, killing Cacus, the work of
Baccio Bandinelli. The quadrangle about this is of the
Corinthian order, and in the hall are many rare marbles,
as those of Leo X. and Clement VII., both Popes of the
Medicean family; also the acts of Cosmo, in rare painting.
In the chapel is kept (as they would make one
believe) the original Gospel of St. John, written with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
own hand; and the famous Florentine Pandects, and
divers precious stones. Near it is another pendent Tower
like that of Pisa, always threatening ruin.</p>

<p>Under the Court of Justice is a stately arcade for men to
walk in, and over that, the shops of divers rare artists who
continually work for the great Duke. Above this is that
renowned Ceimeliarcha, or repository, wherein are hundreds
of admirable antiquities, statues of marble and
metal, vases of porphyry, etc.; but among the statues none
so famous as the Scipio, the Boar, the Idol of Apollo,
brought from the Delphic Temple, and two triumphant
columns. Over these hang the pictures of the most
famous persons and illustrious men in arts or arms, to
the number of 300, taken out of the museum of Paulus
Jovius. They then led us into a large square room, in the
middle of which stood a cabinet of an octangular form,
so adorned and furnished with crystals, agates, and sculptures,
as exceeds any description. This cabinet is called
the <i>Tribuna</i> and in it is a pearl as big as an hazelnut.
The cabinet is of ebony, lazuli, and jasper; over the door
is a round of M. Angelo; on the cabinet, Leo X. with
other paintings of Raphael, del Sarto, Perugino, and
Correggio, viz, a St. John, a Virgin, a Boy, two Apostles,
two heads of Durer, rarely carved. Over this cabinet is
a globe of ivory, excellently carved; the Labors of Hercules,
in massy silver, and many incomparable pictures in
small. There is another, which had about it eight Oriental
columns of alabaster, on each whereof was placed a
head of a Cæsar, covered with a canopy so richly set with
precious stones, that they resembled a firmament of stars.
Within it was our Savior's Passion, and the twelve
Apostles in amber. This cabinet was valued at two
hundred thousand crowns. In another, with calcedon
pillars, was a series of golden medals. Here is also
another rich ebony cabinet cupolaed with a tortoise shell,
and containing a collection of gold medals esteemed worth
50,000 crowns; a wreathed pillar of Oriental alabaster,
divers paintings of Da Vinci, Pontorno, del Sarto, an
<i>Ecce Homo</i> of Titian, a Boy of Bronzini, etc. They
showed us a branch of coral fixed on the rock, which they
affirm does still grow. In another room, is kept the
Tabernacle appointed for the chapel of St. Laurence,
about which are placed small statues of Saints, of precious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
material; a piece of such art and cost, that having been
these forty years in perfecting, it is one of the most
curious things in the world. Here were divers tables of
Pietra Commesso, which is a marble ground inlaid with
several sorts of marbles and stones of various colors representing
flowers, trees, beasts, birds, and landscapes. In
one is represented the town of Leghorn, by the same hand
who inlaid the altar of St. Laurence, Domenico Benotti, of
whom I purchased nineteen pieces of the same work for
a cabinet. In a press near this they showed an iron nail,
one half whereof being converted into gold by one Thurnheuser,
a German chemist, is looked on as a great rarity;
but it plainly appeared to have been soldered together.
There is a curious watch, a monstrous turquoise as big as
an egg, on which is carved an emperor's head.</p>

<p>In the armory are kept many antique habits, as those
of Chinese kings; the sword of Charlemagne; Hannibal's
headpiece; a loadstone of a yard long, which bears up
86 lbs. weight, in a chain of seventeen links, such as the
slaves are tied to. In another room are such rare turneries
in ivory, as are not to be described for their curiosity.
There is a fair pillar of oriental alabaster; twelve
vast and complete services of silver plate, and one of
gold, all of excellent workmanship; a rich embroidered
saddle of pearls sent by the Emperor to this Duke; and
here is that embroidered chair set with precious stones
in which he sits, when, on St. John's day, he receives
the tribute of the cities.</p>
