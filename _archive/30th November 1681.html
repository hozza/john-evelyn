<p>Sir Christopher Wren chosen
President [of the Royal Society], Mr. Austine, Secretary,
with Dr. Plot, the ingenious author of the "History of
Oxfordshire." There was a most illustrious appearance.</p>

<p>11th January, 1681-82. I saw the audience of the
Morocco Ambassador, his retinue not numerous. He
was received in the Banqueting House, both their Maj<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>esties
being present. He came up to the throne without
making any sort of reverence, not bowing his head, or
body. He spoke by a renegado Englishman, for whose
safe return there was a promise. They were all clad in
the Moorish habit, cassocks of colored cloth, or silk,
with buttons and loops, over this an <i>alhaga</i>, or white
woolen mantle, so large as to wrap both head and body,
a sash, or small turban, naked-legged and armed, but
with leather socks like the Turks, rich scymetar, and
large calico sleeved shirts. The Ambassador had a string
of pearls oddly woven in his turban. I fancy the old
Roman habit was little different as to the mantle and
naked limbs. He was a handsome person, well featured,
of a wise look, subtle, and extremely civil. Their presents
were lions and ostriches; their errand about a
peace at Tangier. But the concourse and tumult of the
people was intolerable, so as the officers could keep no
order, which these strangers were astonished <a id="tn_png_176"></a><!--TN: "at at" changed to "at" on Page 163-->at first,
there being nothing so regular, exact, and performed
with such silence, as is on all these public occasions
of their country, and indeed over all the Turkish dominions.</p>
