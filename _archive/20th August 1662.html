<p>There were strong guards in the
city this day, apprehending some tumults, many of the
Presbyterian ministers not conforming. I dined with
the Vice-Chamberlain, and then went to see the Queen-Mother,
who was pleased to give me many thanks for
the entertainment she received at my house, when she
recounted to me many observable stories of the sagacity
of some dogs she formerly had.</p>
