<p>Mr. Offley preached at Abinger;
too much controversy on a point of no consequence, for
the country people here. This was the first time I had
heard him preach. Bombarding of Cadiz; a cruel and
brutish way of making war, first began by the French.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
The season wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest
weather. My good and worthy friend, Captain Gifford,
who that he might get some competence to live decently,
adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the
East Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some
French men-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the
loss of near Â£70,000, to my great sorrow, and pity of his
wife, he being also a valiant and industrious man. The
losses of this sort to the nation have been immense, and
all through negligence, and little care to secure the same
near our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the
public than spending their time in bombarding and
ruining two or three paltry towns, without any benefit,
or weakening our enemies, who, though they began, ought
not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity,
or Christianity.</p>
