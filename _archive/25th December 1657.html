<p>I went to London with my wife,
to celebrate Christmas-day, Mr. Gunning preaching in
Exeter chapel, on Micah vii. 2. Sermon ended, as he
was giving us the Holy Sacrament, the chapel was surrounded
with soldiers, and all the communicants and
assembly surprised and kept prisoners by them, some in
the house, others carried away. It fell to my share to
be confined to a room in the house, where yet I was
permitted to dine with the master of it, the Countess of
Dorset, Lady Hatton, and some others of quality who
invited me. In the afternoon, came Colonel Whalley,
Goffe, and others, from Whitehall, to examine us one by
one; some they committed to the marshal, some to prison.
When I came before them, they took my name and abode,
examined me why, contrary to the ordinance made, that
none should any longer observe the superstitious time of
the nativity (so esteemed by them), I durst offend, and
particularly be at common prayers, which they told me
was but the mass in English, and particularly pray for
Charles Stuart; for which we had no Scripture. I told
them we did not pray for Charles Stuart, but for all
Christian kings, princes, and governors. They replied,
in so doing we prayed for the king of Spain, too, who
was their enemy and a Papist, with other frivolous and
ensnaring questions, and much threatening; and, finding
no color to detain me, they dismissed me with much pity
of my ignorance. These were men of high flight and
above ordinances, and spoke spiteful things of our Lord's
nativity. As we went up to receive the Sacrament, the
miscreants held their muskets against us, as if they would
have shot us at the altar; but yet suffering us to finish
the office of Communion, as perhaps not having instructions
what to do, in case they found us in that action.
So I got home late the next day; blessed be God!</p>

<p>27th January, 1657-58. After six fits of a quartan ague,
with which it pleased God to visit him, died my dear son,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
Richard, to our inexpressible grief and affliction, five
years and three days old only, but at that tender age a
prodigy for wit and understanding; for beauty of body,
a very angel; for endowment of mind, of incredible and
rare hopes. To give only a little taste of them, and thereby
glory to God, who "out of the mouths of babes and infants
does sometimes perfect his praises," he had learned
all his catechism; at two years and a half old, he could
perfectly read any of the English, Latin, French, or Gothic
letters, pronouncing the first three languages exactly.
He had, before the fifth year, or in that year, not only
skill to read most written hands, but to decline all the
nouns, conjugate the verbs regular, and most of the
irregular; learned out "Puerilis," got by heart almost the
entire vocabulary of Latin and French primitives and
words, could make congruous syntax, turn English into
Latin, and <i>vice versâ</i>, construe and prove what he read,
and did the government and use of relatives, verbs, substantives,
ellipses, and many figures and tropes, and made
a considerable progress in Comenius's "<i>Janua</i>"; began
himself to write legibly, and had a strong passion for
Greek. The number of verses he could recite was prodigious,
and what he remembered of the parts of plays,
which he would also act; and, when seeing a Plautus in
one's hand, he asked what book it was, and, being told
it was comedy, and too difficult for him, he wept for sorrow.
Strange was his apt and ingenious application of
fables and morals; for he had read Æsop; he had a wonderful
disposition to mathematics, having by heart divers
propositions of Euclid that were read to him in play, and
he would make lines and demonstrate them. As to his
piety, astonishing were his applications of Scripture upon
occasion, and his sense of God; he had learned all his
catechism early, and understood the historical part of the
Bible and New Testament to a wonder, how Christ came
to redeem mankind, and how, comprehending these necessaries
himself, his godfathers were discharged of their
promise.</p>

<p>These and the like illuminations, far exceeding his age
and experience, considering the prettiness of his address
and behavior, cannot but leave impressions in me at the
memory of him. When one told him how many days a
Quaker had fasted, he replied that was no wonder; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Christ had said that man should not live by bread alone,
but by the Word of God. He would of himself select
the most pathetic psalms, and chapters out of Job, to
read to his maid during his sickness, telling her, when
she pitied him, that all God's children must suffer affliction.
He declaimed against the vanities of the world,
before he had seen any. Often he would desire those
who came to see him to pray by him, and a year before
he fell sick, to kneel and pray with him alone in some
corner. How thankfully would he receive admonition!
how soon be reconciled! how indifferent, yet continually
cheerful! He would give grave advice to his brother,
John, bear with his impertinences, and say he was but
a child. If he heard of or saw any new thing, he was
unquiet till he was told how it was made; he brought to
us all such difficulties as he found in books, to be expounded.
He had learned by heart divers sentences in
Latin and Greek, which, on occasion, he would produce
even to wonder. He was all life, all prettiness, far from
morose, sullen, or childish in anything he said or did.
The last time he had been at church (which was at
Greenwich), I asked him, according to custom, what he
remembered of the sermon; two good things, Father,
said he, <i>bonum gratiæ</i> and <i>bonum gloriæ</i>, with a just
account of what the preacher said.</p>

<p>The day before he died, he called to me: and in a
more serious manner than usual, told me that for all I
loved him so dearly I should give my house, land, and
all my fine things to his brother Jack, he should have
none of them; and, the next morning, when he found
himself ill, and that I persuaded him to keep his hands
in bed, he demanded whether he might pray to God with
his hands unjoined; and a little after, while in great
agony, whether he should not offend God by using his
holy name so often calling for ease. What shall I say of
his frequent pathetical ejaculations uttered of himself:
"Sweet Jesus, save me, deliver me, pardon my sins, let
thine angels receive me!" So early knowledge, so much
piety and perfection! But thus God, having dressed up
a saint fit for himself, would not longer permit him with us,
unworthy of the future fruits of this incomparable hopeful
blossom. Such a Child I never saw: for such a child
I bless God, in whose bosom he is! May I and mine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
become as this little child, who now follows the child Jesus
that Lamb of God in a white robe, whithersoever he
goes; even so, Lord Jesus, <i>fiat voluntas tua</i>! Thou
gavest him to us, thou hast taken him from us, blessed
be the name of the Lord! That I had anything acceptable
to thee was from thy grace alone, seeing from me
he had nothing but sin, but that thou hast pardoned!
blessed be my God for ever, Amen.</p>

<p>In my opinion, he was suffocated by the women and
maids that attended him, and covered him too hot with
blankets as he lay in a cradle, near an excessive hot fire
in a close room. I suffered him to be opened, when they
found that he was what is vulgarly called liver-grown.
I caused his body to be coffined in lead, and deposited on
the 30th at eight o'clock that night in the church at Deptford,
accompanied with divers of my relations and neighbors,
among whom I distributed rings with this motto:
"<i>Dominus abstulit</i>;" intending, God willing, to have him
transported with my own body to be interred in our dormitory
in Wotton Church, in my dear native county of
Surrey, and to lay my bones and mingle my dust with
my fathers, if God be gracious to me, and make me as
fit for him as this blessed child was. The Lord Jesus
sanctify this and all other my afflictions, Amen.</p>

<p>Here ends the joy of my life, and for which I go even
mourning to the grave.</p>
