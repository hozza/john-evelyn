<p>I went, this afternoon, to visit
my Lord John Somerset, brother to the Marquis of
Worcester, who had his apartment in Palazzo della Cancellaria,
belonging to Cardinal Francesco Barberini, as
Vice-chancellor of the Church of Rome, and Protector of
the English. The building is of the famous architect,
Bramante, of incrusted marble, with four ranks of noble
lights; the principal entrance is of Fontana's design, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
all marble; the portico within sustained by massy columns;
on the second peristyle above, the chambers are rarely
painted by Salviati and Vasari; and so ample is this
palace, that six princes with their families have been
received in it at one time, without incommoding each other.</p>
