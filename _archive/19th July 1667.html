<p>I went to Gravesend; the Dutch fleet
still at anchor before the river, where I saw five of his
Majesty's men-at-war encounter above twenty of the
Dutch, in the bottom of the Hope, chasing them with
many broadsides given and returned toward the buoy of
the Nore, where the body of their fleet lay, which lasted
till about midnight. One of their ships was fired, supposed
by themselves, she being run on ground. Having
seen this bold action, and their braving us so far up the
river, I went home the next day, not without indignation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
at our negligence, and the nation's reproach. It is well
known who of the Commissioners of the Treasury gave
advice that the charge of setting forth a fleet this year
might be spared, Sir W. C. (William Coventry) by
name.</p>
