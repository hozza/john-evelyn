<p>Great alterations of officers at
Court, and elsewhere,â€”Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he
was a learned man in his profession, of which we have
now few, never fewer; the Chancery requiring so little
skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can talk eloquently
in that Court; so that probably few care to study
the law to any purpose. Lord Marlborough Master of the
Ordnance, in place of Lord Romney made Groom of the
Stole. The Earl of Rochester goes Lord Lieutenant to
Ireland.</p>

<p>January, 1700-01. I finished the sale of North Stoake in
Sussex to Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother
to be sold for payment of portions to my nieces, and
other incumbrances on the estate.</p>
