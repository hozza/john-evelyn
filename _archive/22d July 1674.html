<p>I went to Windsor with my wife
and son to see my daughter Mary, who was there with
my Lady Tuke and to do my duty to his Majesty. Next
day, to a great entertainment at Sir Robert Holmes's at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Cranbourne Lodge, in the Forest; there were his Majesty,
the Queen, Duke, Duchess, and all the Court. I
returned in the evening with Sir Joseph Williamson, now
declared Secretary of State. He was son of a poor
clergyman somewhere in Cumberland, brought up at
Queen's College, Oxford, of which he came to be a fellow;
then traveled with ... and returning when the
King was restored, was received as a clerk under Mr.
Secretary Nicholas. Sir Henry Bennett (now Lord Arlington)
succeeding, Williamson is transferred to him, who
loving his ease more than business (though sufficiently
able had he applied himself to it) remitted all to his man
Williamson; and, in a short time, let him so into the
secret of affairs, that (as his Lordship himself told me)
there was a kind of necessity to advance him; and so, by
his subtlety, dexterity, and insinuation, he got now to be
principal Secretary; absolutely Lord Arlington's creature,
and ungrateful enough. It has been the fate of this
obliging favorite to advance those who soon forgot their
original. Sir Joseph was a musician, could play at <i>Jeu
de Goblets</i>, exceedingly formal, a severe master to his servants,
but so inward with my Lord O'Brien, that after a
few months of that gentleman's death, he married his
widow,<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_35_35">35</a> who, being sister and heir of the Duke of Richmond,
brought him a noble fortune. It was thought they
lived not so kindly after marriage as they did before.
She was much censured for marrying so meanly, being
herself allied to the Royal family.</p>
