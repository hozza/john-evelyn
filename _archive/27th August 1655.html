<p>I went to Boxhill, to see those rare
natural bowers, cabinets, and shady walks in the box
copses: hence we walked to Mickleham, and saw Sir F.
Stidolph's seat, environed with elm trees and walnuts innumerable,
and of which last he told us they received a
considerable revenue. Here are such goodly walks and
hills shaded with yew and box, as render the place extremely
agreeable, it seeming from these evergreens to
be summer all the winter.</p>
