of his Majesty's riding through the city in state to the
Short Parliament, which began the 13th following,â€”a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
glorious and magnificent sight, the King circled with his
royal diadem and the affections of his people: but the
day after I returned to Wotton again, where I stayed,
my father's indisposition suffering great intervals, till
April 27th, when I was sent to London to be first resident

with my brother George to Wotton, who, on the
28th of the same month, was married at Albury to Mrs.
Caldwell (an heiress of an ancient Leicestershire family,
where part of the nuptials were celebrated).</p>
