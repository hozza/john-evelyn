<p>I went with some friends to the Bear
Garden, where was cock-fighting, dog-fighting, bear and
bull-baiting, it being a famous day for all these butcherly
sports, or rather barbarous cruelties. The bulls did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
exceedingly well, but the Irish wolf dog exceeded, which
was a tall greyhound, a stately creature indeed, who
beat a cruel mastiff. One of the bulls tossed a dog full
into a lady's lap as she sat in one of the boxes at a considerable
height from the arena. Two poor dogs were
killed, and so all ended with the ape on horseback, and
I most heartily weary of the rude and dirty pastime,
which I had not seen, I think, in twenty years before.</p>
