<p>Being casually in the privy gallery
at Whitehall, his Majesty gave me thanks before divers lords
and noblemen for my book of "Architecture," and again
for my "<i>Sylva</i>" saying they were the best designed and
useful for the matter and subject, the best printed and
designed (meaning the <i>taille-douces</i> of the Parallel of
Architecture) that he had seen. He then caused me to
follow him alone to one of the windows, and asked me
if I had any paper about me unwritten, and a crayon; I
presented him with both, and then laying it on the
window-stool, he with his own hands designed to me the
plot for the future building of Whitehall, together with
the rooms of state, and other particulars. After this, he
talked with me of several matters, asking my advice, in
which I find his Majesty had an extraordinary talent becoming
a magnificent prince.</p>

<p>The same day at Council, there being Commissioners
to be made to take care of such sick and wounded and
prisoners of war, as might be expected upon occasion of
a succeeding war and action at sea, war being already
declared <a id="tn_png_413"></a><!--TN: "againt" changed to "against"-->against the Hollanders, his Majesty was pleased
to nominate me to be one, with three other gentlemen,
Parliament men, viz, Sir William Doily, Knt. and Bart.,
Sir Thomas Clifford, and Bullein Rheymes, Esq.; with a
salary of £1,200 a year among us, besides extraordinaries
for our care and attention in time of station,
each of us being appointed to a particular district, mine
falling out to be Kent and Sussex, with power to constitute
officers, physicians, chirurgeons, provost-marshals,
and to dispose of half of the hospitals through England.
After the Council, we kissed his Majesty's hand. At this
Council I heard Mr. Solicitor Finch plead most elegantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
for the merchants trading to the Canaries, praying for a
new Charter.</p>
