<p>I am this day arrived to the 85th
year of my age. Lord teach me so to number my days
to come, that I may apply them to wisdom!</p>

<p>1st January, 1705-06. Making up my accounts for the
past year, paid bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according
to custom. Though much indisposed and in so advanced
a stage, I went to our chapel [in London] to
give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to
assist me and my family the ensuing year, if he should
yet continue my pilgrimage here, and bring me at last
to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.
Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.</p>
