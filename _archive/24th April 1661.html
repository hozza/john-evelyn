<p>I presented his Majesty with his
"Panegyric"<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_66_66">66</a> in the Privy Chamber, which he was pleased
to accept most graciously; I gave copies to the Lord
Chancellor, and most of the noblemen who came to me
for it. I dined at the Marquis of Ormond's where was a
magnificent feast, and many great persons.</p>
