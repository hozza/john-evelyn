<p>We had now the welcome tidings
of the King of Poland raising the siege of Vienna, which
had given terror to all Europe, and utmost reproach to
the French, who it is believed brought in the Turks for
diversion, that the French King might the more easily
swallow Flanders, and pursue his unjust conquest on
the empire, while we sat unconcerned and under a deadly
charm from somebody.</p>

<p>There was this day a collection for rebuilding Newmarket,
consumed by an accidental fire, which removing
his Majesty thence sooner than was intended, put by the
assassins, who were disappointed of their rendezvous and
expectation by a wonderful providence. This made the
King more earnest to render Winchester the seat of his
autumnal field diversions for the future, designing a palace
there, where the ancient castle stood; infinitely indeed
preferable to Newmarket for prospects, air, pleasure,
and provisions. The surveyor has already begun the
foundation for a palace, estimated to cost Â£35,000, and
his Majesty is purchasing ground about it to make a
park, etc.</p>
