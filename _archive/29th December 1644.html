<p>We were invited by the English
Jesuits to dinner, being their great feast of Thomas [Ã 
Becket] of Canterbury. We dined in their common refectory,
and afterward saw an Italian comedy acted by
their alumni before the Cardinals.</p>

<p>January, 1645. We saw pass the new officers of the
people of Rome; especially, for their noble habits were
most conspicuous, the three Consuls, now called Conservators,
who take their places in the Capitol, having
been sworn the day before between the hands of the
Pope. We ended the day with the rare music at the
Chiesa Nova.</p>
