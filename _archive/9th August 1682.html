<p>The Council of the Royal Society
had it recommended to them to be trustees and visitors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
or supervisors, of the Academy which Monsieur Faubert
did hope to procure to be built by subscription of worthy
gentlemen and noblemen, for the education of youth, and
to lessen the vast expense the nation is at yearly by
sending children into France to be taught military
exercises. We thought to give him all the encouragement
our recommendation could procure.</p>
