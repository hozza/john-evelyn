<p>Mr. Bentley preached at the Tabernacle,
near Golden Square. I gave my voice for him
to proceed on his former subject the following year in
Mr. Boyle's lecture, in which he had been interrupted by
the importunity of Sir J.Â Rotheram that the Bishop of
Chichester<a id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_80_80">80</a> might be chosen the year before, to the great
dissatisfaction of the Bishop of Lincoln and myself. We
chose Mr. Bentley again. The Duchess of Grafton's appeal
to the House of Lords for the Prothonotary's place
given to the late Duke and to her son by King Charles
II., now challenged by the Lord Chief Justice. The
judges were severely reproved on something they said.</p>
