<p>I went with my Lord Viscount
Cornbury, to Cornbury, in Oxfordshire, to assist him in
the planting of the park, and bear him company, with
Mr. Belin and Mr. May, in a coach with six horses;
dined at Uxbridge, lay at Wycombe.</p>

<p>18th October, <a id="tn_png_411"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period after "1664"-->1664. At Oxford. Went through Woodstock,
where we beheld the destruction of that royal seat
and park by the late rebels, and arrived that evening at
Cornbury, a house lately built by the Earl of Denbigh, in
the middle of a sweet park, walled with a dry wall. The
house is of excellent freestone, abounding in that part,
(a stone that is fine, but never sweats, or casts any damp);
it is of ample dimensions, has goodly cellars, the paving of
the hall admirable for its close laying. We designed a
handsome chapel that was yet wanting: as Mr. May had
the stables, which indeed are very fair, having set out the
walks in the parks and gardens. The lodge is a pretty
solitude, and the ponds very convenient; the park well
stored.</p>
