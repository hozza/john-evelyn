<p>In the afternoon, preached at
the Abbey Dr. Basire, that great traveler, or rather
French Apostle, who had been planting the Church of
England in divers parts of the Levant and Asia. He
showed that the Church of England was, for purity of
doctrine, substance, decency, and beauty, the most perfect
under Heaven; that England was the very land of Goshen.</p>
