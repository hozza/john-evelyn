<p>I dined with the Archbishop of
York, where was Peter Walsh, that Romish priest so well
known for his moderation, professing the Church of England
to be a true member of the Catholic Church. He
is used to go to our public prayers without scruple, and
did not acknowledge the Pope's infallibility, only primacy
of order.</p>
