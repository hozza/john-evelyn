<p>To London, with Mr. Henry
Howard, of Norfolk, of whom I obtained the gift of his
Arundelian marbles, those celebrated and famous inscriptions,
Greek and Latin, gathered with so much cost and
industry from Greece, by his illustrious grandfather, the
magnificent Earl of Arundel, my noble friend while he
lived. When I saw these precious monuments miserably
neglected, and scattered up and down about the garden,
and other parts of Arundel House, and how exceedingly
the corrosive air of London impaired them, I procured
him to bestow them on the University of Oxford. This
he was pleased to grant me; and now gave me the key
of the gallery, with leave to mark all those stones, urns,
altars, etc., and whatever I found had inscriptions on
them, that were not statues. This I did; and getting them
removed and piled together, with those which were incrusted
in the garden walls, I sent immediately letters to
the Vice-Chancellor of what I had procured, and that if
they esteemed it a service to the University (of which I
had been a member), they should take order for their
transportation.</p>

<p>This done 21st, I accompanied Mr. Howard to his villa
at Albury, where I designed for him the plot of his canal
and garden, with a crypt through the hill.</p>
