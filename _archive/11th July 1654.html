<p>Was the Latin sermon, which I could
not be at, though invited, being taken up at All Souls,
where we had <a id="tn_png_322b"></a><!--TN: Comma added after "music"-->music, voices, and theorbos, performed by
some ingenious scholars. After dinner, I visited that
miracle of a youth, Mr. Christopher Wren, nephew to
the Bishop of Ely. Then Mr. Barlow (since Bishop of
Lincoln), bibliothecarius of the Bodleian Library, my
most learned friend. He showed us the rarities of that
most famous place, manuscripts, medals, and other curiosities.
Among the MSS. an old English Bible, wherein<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the Eunuch mentioned to be baptized by Philip, is
called the Gelding: "and Philip and the Gelding went
down into the water," etc. The original Acts of the
Council of Basil 900 years since, with the <i>bulla</i>, or leaden
affix, which has a silken cord passing through every
parchment; a <a id="tn_png_323"></a><!--TN: "MSS." changed to "MS."-->MS. of Venerable Bede of 800 years antiquity;
the old Ritual <i>secundum usum Sarum</i> exceeding
voluminous; then, among the nicer curiosities, the "Proverbs
of Solomon," written in French by a lady, every
chapter of a several character, or hand, the most exquisite
imaginable; an hieroglyphical table, or carta,
folded up like a map, I suppose it painted on asses' hide,
extremely rare; but, what is most illustrious, there were
no less than 1,000 MSS. in nineteen languages, especially
Oriental, furnishing that new part of the library built by
Archbishop Laud, from a design of Sir Kenelm Digby and
the Earl of Pembroke. In the closet of the tower, they
show some Indian weapons, urns, lamps, etc., but the rarest
is the whole Alcoran, written on one large sheet of calico,
made up in a priest's vesture, or cope, after the Turkish
and Arabic character, so exquisitely written, as no printed
letter comes near it; also, a roll of magical charms,
divers talismans, and some medals.</p>

<p>Then, I led my wife into the Convocation House, finely
wainscoted; the Divinity School, and Gothic carved roof;
the Physic, or Anatomy School, adorned with some rarities
of natural things; but nothing extraordinary save the
skin of a jackal, a rarely-colored jackatoo, or prodigious
large parrot, two humming birds, not much bigger than
our bumblebee, which indeed I had not seen before,
that I remember.</p>
