<p>To London about Sir Nicholas
Crisp's designs.</p>

<p>I went to see York House and gardens, belonging to the
former great Buckingham, but now much ruined through
neglect.</p>

<p>Thence, to visit honest and learned Mr.Â Hartlib, a public
spirited and ingenious person, who had propagated
many useful things and arts. He told me of the castles
which they set for ornament on their stoves in Germany
(he himself being a Lithuanian, as I remember), which
are furnished with small ordnance of silver on the battlements,
out of which they discharge excellent perfumes
about the rooms, charging them with a little powder to
set them on fire, and disperse the smoke: and in truth
no more than need, for their stoves are sufficiently nasty.
He told me of an ink that would give a dozen copies,
moist sheets of paper being pressed on it; and remain
perfect; and a receipt how to take off any print without
the least injury to the original. This gentleman was
master of innumerable curiosities, and very communicative.
I returned home that evening by water; and was
afflicted for it with a cold that had almost killed me.</p>

<p>This day, came forth the Protector's Edict, or Proclamation,
prohibiting all ministers of the Church of England
from preaching or teaching any schools, in which
he imitated the apostate, Julian; with the decimation of
all the royal party's revenues throughout England.</p>
