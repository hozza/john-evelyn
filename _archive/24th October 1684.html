<p>I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's with
the Duke of Northumberland. He seemed to be a young
gentleman of good capacity, well bred, civil and modest:
newly come from travel, and had made his campaign at
the siege of Luxemburg. Of all his Majesty's children
(of which he had now six Dukes) this seemed the most
accomplished and worth the owning. He is extraordi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>narily
handsome and well shaped. What the Dukes of
Richmond and St. Alban's will prove, their youth does
not yet discover; they are very pretty boys.</p>
