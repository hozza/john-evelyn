<p>To London, invited to the consecration
of that excellent person, the Dean of Ripon,
Dr. Wilkins, now made Bishop of Chester; it was at
Ely House, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Cosin,
Bishop of Durham, the Bishops of Ely, Salisbury, Rochester,
and others officiating. Dr. Tillotson preached.
Then, we went to a sumptuous dinner in the hall, where
were the Duke of Buckingham, Judges, Secretaries of
State, Lord-Keeper, Council, Noblemen, and innumerable
other company, who were honorers of this incomparable
man, universally beloved by all who knew him.</p>

<p>This being the Queen's birthday, great was the gallantry
at Whitehall, and the night celebrated with very
fine fireworks.</p>

<p>My poor brother continuing ill, I went not from him
till the 17th, when, dining at the Groom Porters, I heard
Sir Edward Sutton play excellently on the Irish harp;
he performs genteelly, but not approaching my worthy
friend, Mr. Clark, a gentleman of Northumberland, who
makes it execute lute, viol, and all the harmony an instrument
is capable of; pity it is that it is not more in
use; but, indeed, to play well, takes up the whole man,
as Mr. Clark has assured me, who, though a gentleman
of quality and parts, was yet brought up to that instrument
from five years old, as I remember he told me.</p>
