<p>We went by coach to take the
air, and see the diversions, or rather madness of the
Carnival; the courtesans (who swarm in this city to the
number, as we are told, of 30,000, registered and paying
a tax to the State) flinging eggs of sweet water into our
coach, as we passed by the houses and windows. Indeed,
the town is so pestered with these cattle, that there
needs no small mortification to preserve from their enchantment,
while they display all their natural and artificial
beauty, play, sing, feign compliment, and by a
thousand studied devices seek to inveigle foolish young
men.</p>
