<p>The King was this night very
obscurely buried in a vault under Henry VII.'s Chapel at
Westminster, without any manner of pomp, and soon forgotten
after all this vanity, and the face of the whole
Court was exceedingly changed into a more solemn and
moral behavior; the new King affecting neither profaneness
nor buffoonery. All the great officers broke their
staves over the grave, according to form.</p>
