<p>I went with Lord Cornwallis to
see the young gallants do their exercise. Mr. Faubert
having newly railed in a manage, and fitted it for the
academy. There were the Dukes of Norfolk and Northumberland,
Lord Newburgh, and a nephew of (Duras)
Earl of Feversham. The exercises were, 1, running at
the ring; 2, flinging a javelin at a Moor's head; 3, dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>charging
a pistol at a mark; lastly taking up a gauntlet
with the point of a sword; all these performed in full
speed. The Duke of Northumberland hardly missed of
succeeding in every one, a dozen times, as I think. The
Duke of Norfolk did exceeding bravely. Lords Newburgh
and Duras seemed nothing so dexterous. Here I saw
the difference of what the French call "<i>bel homme à cheval</i>,"
and "<i>bon homme à cheval</i>"; the Duke of Norfolk being the
first, that is rather a fine person on a horse, the Duke
of Northumberland being both in perfection, namely, a
graceful person and an excellent rider. But the Duke of
Norfolk told me he had not been at this exercise these
twelve years before. There were in the field the Prince
of Denmark, and the Lord Lansdowne, son of the Earl
of Bath, who had been made a Count of the Empire last
summer for his service before Vienna.</p>
