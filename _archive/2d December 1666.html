<p>Dined with me Monsieur Kiviet, a
Dutch gentleman-pensioner of Rotterdam, who came over
for protection, being of the Prince of Orange's party, now
not welcome in Holland. The King knighted him for some
merit in the Prince's behalf. He should, if caught, have
been beheaded with Monsieur Buat, and was brother-in-law
to Van Tromp, the sea-general. With him came Mr.
Gabriel Sylvius, and Mr. Williamson, secretary to Lord
Arlington; M.Â Kiviet came to examine whether the soil
about the river of Thames would be proper to make clinker
bricks, and to treat with me about some accommodation
in order to it.</p>

<p>9th January, 1666-67. To the Royal Society, which since
the sad conflagration were invited by Mr. Howard to sit
at Arundel-House in the Strand, who at my instigation
likewise bestowed on the Society that noble library which
his grandfather especially, and his ancestors had collected.
This gentleman had so little inclination to books, that it
was the preservation of them from embezzlement.</p>
