<p>I was admitted and then sworn
one of the Council of the Royal Society, being nominated
in his Majesty's original grant to be of this
Council for the regulation of the Society, and making
laws and statutes conducible to its establishment

Brouncker (that excellent mathematician) was also by his
Majesty, our founder, nominated our first President.
The King gave us the arms of England to be borne in
a canton in our arms, and sent us a mace of silver gilt,
of the same fashion and size as those carried before his
Majesty, to be borne before our president on meeting
days. It was brought by Sir Gilbert Talbot, master of
his Majesty's jewel house.</p>
