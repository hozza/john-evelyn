<p>Came his Majesty, the Duke, and many
Noblemen. After Council, we went to prayers. My business
being dispatched, I returned to Chatham, having lain
but one night in the Royal Charles; we had a tempestuous
sea. I went on shore at Sheerness, where they were
building an arsenal for the fleet, and designing a royal
fort with a receptacle for great ships to ride at anchor;
but here I beheld the sad spectacle, more than half that
gallant bulwark of the kingdom miserably shattered, hardly
a vessel entire, but appearing rather so many wrecks and
hulls, so cruelly had the Dutch mangled us. The loss of
the Prince, that gallant vessel, had been a loss to be universally
deplored, none knowing for what reason we first
engaged in this ungrateful war; we lost besides nine or
ten more, and near 600 men slain and 1,100 wounded,
2,000 prisoners; to balance which, perhaps we might destroy
eighteen or twenty of the enemy's ships, and 700 or
800 poor men.</p>
