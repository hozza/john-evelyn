<p>Sir Lewis Dives dined with us,
who relating some of his adventures, showed me divers
pieces of broad gold, which, being in his pocket in a
fight, preserved his life by receiving a musket bullet on
them, which deadened its violence, so that it went no
further; but made such a stroke on the gold as fixed the
impressions upon one another, battering and bending
several of them; the bullet itself was flatted, and retained
on it the color of the gold. He assured us that of a
hundred of them, which it seems he then had in his
pocket, not one escaped without some blemish. He
affirmed that his being protected by a Neapolitan Prince,
who connived at his bringing some horses into France,
contrary to the order of the Viceroy, by assistance of
some banditti, was the occasion of a difference between
those great men, and consequently of the late civil war
in that kingdom, the Viceroy having killed the Prince
standing on his defense at his own castle. He told me
that the second time of the Scots coming into England,
the King was six times their number, and might easily
have beaten them; but was betrayed, as were all other
his designs and counsels, by some, even of his bedchamber,
meaning M. Hamilton, who copied Montrose's
letters from time to time when his Majesty was asleep.</p>
