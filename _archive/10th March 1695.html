<p>I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's
with Lord Spencer. My Lord showed me his
library, now again improved by many books bought at
the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician,
which was the very best collection, especially of
mathematical books, that was I believe in Europe, once
designed for the King's Library at St. James's; but the
Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that
design, it was let fall, and the books were miserably
dissipated.</p>

<p>The new edition of Camden's "Britannia" was now published
(by Bishop Gibson), with great additions; those to
Surrey were mine, so that I had one presented to me.
Dr. Gale showed me a MS. of some parts of the New
Testament in vulgar Latin, that had belonged to a monastery
in the North of Scotland, which he esteemed to
be about eight hundred years old; there were some considerable
various readings observable, as in John i., and
genealogy of St. Luke.</p>
