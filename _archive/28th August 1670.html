<p>One of the Canons preached; then
followed the offering of the Knights of the Order, according
to custom; first the poor Knights, in procession,
then, the Canons in their formalities, the Dean and
Chancellor, then his Majesty (the Sovereign), the Duke
of York, Prince Rupert; and, lastly, the Earl of Oxford,
being all the Knights that were then at Court.</p>

<p>I dined with the Treasurer, and consulted with him
what pieces I was to add; in the afternoon the King
took me aside into the balcony over the terrace, extremely
pleased with what had been told him I had begun,
in order to his commands, and enjoining me to proceed
vigorously in it. He told me he had ordered the Secretaries
of State to give me all necessary assistance of
papers and particulars relating to it and enjoining me to
make it a <span class="small">LITTLE KEEN</span>, for that the Hollanders had very
unhandsomely abused him in their pictures, books, and
libels.</p>

<p>Windsor was now going to be repaired, being exceedingly
ragged and ruinous. Prince Rupert, the Con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>stable,
had begun to trim up the keep or high round
Tower, and handsomely adorned his hall with furniture
of arms, which was very singular, by so disposing the
pikes, muskets, pistols, bandoleers, holsters, drums, back,
breast, and headpieces, as was very extraordinary. Thus,
those huge steep stairs ascending to it had the walls invested
with this martial furniture, all new and bright,
so disposing the bandoleers, holsters, and drums, as to
represent festoons, and that without any confusion,
trophy-like. From the hall we went into his bedchamber,
and ample rooms hung with tapestry, curious and
effeminate pictures, so extremely different from the
other, which presented nothing but war and horror.</p>

<p>The King passed most of his time in hunting the
stag, and walking in the park, which he was now planting
with rows of trees.</p>
