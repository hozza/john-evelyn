<p>The solemn Fast-day. Dr. Meggot
preached an excellent discourse before the King on the
terrors of God's judgments. After sermon, I waited on
my Lord Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of Winchester,
where the Dean of Westminster spoke to me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
about putting into my hands the disposal of fifty pounds,
which the charitable people of Oxford had sent to be
distributed among the sick and wounded seamen since the
battle. Hence, I went to the Lord Chancellor's to joy
him of his Royal Highness's second son, now born at St.
James's; and to desire the use of the Star-chamber for
our Commissioners to meet in, Painters' Hall not being
so convenient.</p>
