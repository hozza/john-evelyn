<p>I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury,
where I found the Bishops of St. Asaph, Ely,
Bath and Wells, Peterborough, and Chichester, the Earls
of Aylesbury and Clarendon, Sir George Mackenzie, Lord-Advocate
of Scotland, and then came in a Scotch Archbishop,
etc. After prayers and dinner, divers serious
matters were discoursed, concerning the present state of
the Public, and sorry I was to find there was as yet no
accord in the judgments of those of the Lords and Commons
who were to convene; some would have the Princess
made Queen without any more dispute, others were for
a Regency; there was a Tory party (then so called), who
were for inviting his Majesty again upon conditions; and
there were Republicans who would make the Prince of
Orange like a Stadtholder. The Romanists were busy
among these several parties to bring them into confusion:
most for ambition or other interest, few for conscience
and moderate resolutions. I found nothing of all
this in this assembly of Bishops, who were pleased to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
admit me into their discourses; they were all for a Regency,
thereby to salve their oaths, and so all public
matters to proceed in his Majesty's name, by that to
facilitate the calling of Parliament, according to the laws
in being. Such was the result of this meeting.</p>

<p>My Lord of Canterbury gave me great thanks for the
advertisement I sent him in October, and assured me
they took my counsel in that particular, and that it came
very seasonably.</p>

<p>I found by the Lord-Advocate that the Bishops of Scotland
(who were indeed little worthy of that character, and
had done much mischief in that Church) were now coming
about to the true interest, in this conjuncture which
threatened to abolish the whole hierarchy in that kingdom;
and therefore the Scottish Archbishop and Lord-Advocate
requested the Archbishop of Canterbury to use his best
endeavors with the Prince to maintain the Church there
in the same state, as by law at present settled.</p>

<p>It now growing late, after some private discourse with
his Grace, I took my leave, most of the Lords being
gone.</p>

<p>The trial of the bishops was now printed.</p>

<p>The great convention being assembled the day before,
falling upon the question about the government, resolved
that King James having by the advice of the Jesuits and
other wicked persons endeavored to subvert the laws of
the Church and State, and deserted the kingdom, carrying
away the seals, etc., without any care for the management
of the government, had by demise abdicated
himself and wholly vacated his right; they did therefore
desire the Lords' concurrence to their vote, to place the
crown on the next heir, the Prince of Orange, for his
life, then to the Princess, his wife, and if she died without
issue, to the Princess of Denmark, and she failing,
to the heirs of the Prince, excluding forever all possibility
of admitting a Roman Catholic.</p>
