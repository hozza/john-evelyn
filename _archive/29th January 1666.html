<p>I went to wait on his Majesty,
now returned from Oxford to Hampton-Court, where the
Duke of Albemarle presented me to him; he ran toward
me, and in a most gracious manner gave me his hand to
kiss, with many thanks for my care and faithfulness in
his service in a time of such great danger, when everybody
fled their employments; he told me he was much
obliged to me, and said he was several times concerned
for me, and the peril I underwent, and did receive my
service most acceptably (though in truth I did but do my
duty, and O that I had performed it as I <a id="tn_png_21"></a><!--TN: Period added after "ought!)"-->ought!). After
this, his Majesty was pleased to talk with me alone, near
an hour, of several particulars of my employment, and
ordered me to attend him again on the Thursday following
at Whitehall. Then the Duke came toward me, and
embraced me with much kindness, telling me if he had
thought my danger would have been so great, he would
not have suffered his Majesty to employ me in that
station. Then came to salute me my Lord of St. Albans,
Lord Arlington, Sir William Coventry, and several great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
persons; after which, I got home, not being very well in
health.</p>

<p>The Court was now in deep mourning for the French
Queen-Mother.</p>
