<p>I dined with my Lord Keeper,
[North], and walking alone with him some time in his
gallery, we had discourse of music. He told me he had
been brought up to it from a child, so as to sing his
part at first sight. Then speaking of painting, of which
he was also a great lover, and other ingenious matters,
he desired me to come oftener to him.</p>
