<p>I dined with Mr. Pepys, where was
Dr. Cumberland, the new Bishop of Norwich,<a id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_77_77">77</a> Dr. Lloyd
having been put out for not acknowledging the Government.
Cumberland is a very learned, excellent man.
Possession was now given to Dr. Tillotson, at Lambeth,
by the Sheriff; Archbishop Sancroft was gone, but had
left his nephew to keep possession; and he refusing to
deliver it up on the Queen's message, was dispossessed
by the Sheriff, and imprisoned. This stout demeanor of
the few Bishops who refused to take the oaths to King
William, animated a great party to forsake the churches,
so as to threaten a schism; though those who looked
further into the ancient practice, found that when (as
formerly) there were Bishops displaced on secular accounts,
the people never refused to acknowledge the new
Bishops, provided they were not heretics. The truth is,
the whole clergy had till now stretched the duty of
passive obedience, so that the proceedings against these
Bishops gave no little occasion of exceptions; but this
not amounting to heresy, there was a necessity of receiving
the new Bishops, to prevent a failure of that
order in the Church. I went to visit Lord Clarendon
in the Tower, but he was gone into the country for
air by the Queen's permission, under the care of his
warden.</p>
