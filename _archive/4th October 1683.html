<p>I went to London, on receiving a
note from the Countess of Arlington, of some considerable
charge or advantage I might obtain by applying myself
to his Majesty on this signal conjuncture of his
Majesty entering up judgment against the city charter;
the proposal made me I wholly declined, not being well
satisfied with these violent transactions, and not a little
sorry that his Majesty was so often put upon things of
this nature against so great a city, the consequence
whereof may be so much to his prejudice; so I returned
home. At this time, the Lord Chief-Justice Pemberton
was displaced. He was held to be the most learned of
the judges, and an honest man. Sir George Jeffreys was
advanced, reputed to be most ignorant, but most daring.
Sir George Treby, Recorder of London, was also put by,
and one Genner, an obscure lawyer, set in his place.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Eight of the richest and chief aldermen were removed
and all the rest made only justices of the peace, and no
more wearing of gowns, or chains of gold; the Lord
Mayor and two sheriffs holding their places by new grants
as <i>custodes</i>, at the King's pleasure. The pomp and
grandeur of the most august city in the world thus changed
face in a moment; which gave great occasion of discourse
and thoughts of hearts, what all this would end in. Prudent
men were for the old foundations.</p>

<p>Following his Majesty this morning through the gallery,
I went with the few who attended him, into the
Duchess of Portmouth's <span class="small">DRESSING ROOM</span> within her bedchamber,
where she was in her morning loose garment,
her maids combing her, newly out of her bed, his Majesty
and the gallants standing about her; but that which engaged
my curiosity, was the rich and splendid furniture
of this woman's apartment, now twice or thrice pulled
down and rebuilt to satisfy her prodigal and expensive
pleasures, while her Majesty's does not exceed some gentlemen's
ladies in furniture and accommodation. Here I
saw the new fabric of French tapestry, for design, tenderness
of work, and incomparable imitation of the best
paintings, beyond anything I had ever beheld. Some
pieces had Versailles, St. Germains, and other palaces of
the French King, with huntings, figures, and landscapes,
exotic fowls, and all to the life rarely done. Then for
Japan cabinets, screens, pendule clocks, great vases of
wrought plate, tables, stands, chimney-furniture, sconces,
branches, braseras, etc., all of massy silver and out of
number, besides some of her Majesty's best paintings.</p>

<p>Surfeiting of this, I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's and
went contented home to my poor, but quiet villa. What
contentment can there be in the riches and splendor of
this world, purchased with vice and dishonor?</p>
