<p>Dined at the Countess of Sun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>derland's,
and was this evening at the remarriage of
the Duchess of Grafton to the Duke (his Majesty's natural
son), she being now twelve years old. The ceremony
was performed in my Lord Chamberlain's (her
father's) lodgings at Whitehall by the Bishop of Rochester,
his Majesty being present. A sudden and unexpected
thing, when everybody believed the first marriage would
have come to nothing; but, the measure being determined,
I was privately invited by my Lady, her mother, to be
present. I confess I could give her little joy, and so I
plainly told her, but she said the King would have it so,
and there was no going back. This sweetest, most hopeful,
most beautiful, child, and most virtuous, too, was sacrificed
to a boy that had been rudely bred, without anything
to encourage them but his Majesty's pleasure. I
pray God the sweet child find it to her advantage, who,
if my augury deceive me not, will in a few years be such a
paragon as were fit to make the wife of the greatest
Prince in Europe! I staid supper, where his Majesty
sat between the Duchess of Cleveland (the mother of the
Duke of Grafton) and the sweet Duchess the bride; there
were several great persons and ladies, without pomp.
My love to my Lord Arlington's family, and the sweet
child made me behold all this with regret, though as the
Duke of Grafton affects the sea, to which I find his
father intends to use him, he may emerge a plain, useful
and robust officer: and were he polished, a tolerable person;
for he is exceedingly handsome, by far surpassing
any of the King's other natural issue.</p>
