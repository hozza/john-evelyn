<p>The Countesses of Bristol and Sunderland,
aunt and cousin-german of the late Lord Russell,
came to visit me, and condole his sad fate. The next day,
came Colonel Russell, uncle to the late Lord Russell, and
brother to the Earl of Bedford, and with him Mrs. Middleton,
that famous and indeed incomparable beauty,
daughter to my relation, Sir Robert Needham.</p>
