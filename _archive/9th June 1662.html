<p>I heard the Queen's Portugal music,
consisting of pipes, harps, and very ill voices.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAMPTON COURT</div>

<p>Hampton Court is as noble and uniform a pile, and as
capacious as any Gothic architecture can have made it.
There is an incomparable furniture in it, especially hangings
designed by Raphael, very rich with gold; also
many rare pictures, especially the Cæsarean Triumphs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
Andrea Mantegna, formerly the Duke of Mantua's; of
the tapestries, I believe the world can show nothing
nobler of the kind than the stories of Abraham and
Tobit. The gallery of horns is very particular for the
vast beams of stags, elks, antelopes, etc. The Queen's
bed was an embroidery of silver on crimson velvet, and
cost £8,000, being a present made by the States of Holland
when his Majesty returned, and had formerly been
given by them to our King's sister, the Princess of
Orange, and, being bought of her again, was now presented
to the King. The great looking-glass and toilet,
of beaten and massive gold, was given by the Queen-Mother.
The Queen brought over with her from Portugal
such Indian cabinets as had never before been seen here.
The great hall is a most magnificent room. The chapel
roof excellently fretted and gilt. I was also curious to
visit the wardrobe and tents, and other furniture of
state. The park, formerly a flat and naked piece of
ground, now planted with sweet rows of lime trees; and
the canal for water now near perfected; also the air-park.
In the garden is a rich and noble fountain, with Sirens,
statues, etc., cast in copper, by Fanelli; but no plenty of
water. The cradle-work of horn beam in the garden is,
for the perplexed twining of the trees, very observable.
There is a parterre which they call Paradise, in which is
a pretty banqueting-house set over a cave, or cellar.
All these gardens might be exceedingly improved, as
being too narrow for such a palace.</p>
