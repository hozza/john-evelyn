<p>I went to the Ch√¢telet, or prison,
where a malefactor was to have the question, or torture,
given to him, he refusing to confess the robbery
with which he was charged, which was thus: they first
bound his wrist with a strong rope, or small cable, and
one end of it to an iron ring made fast to the wall, about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
four feet from the floor, and then his feet with another
cable, fastened about five feet further than his utmost
length to another ring on the floor of the room. Thus
suspended, and yet lying but aslant, they slid a horse of
wood under the rope which bound his feet, which so exceedingly
stiffened it, as severed the fellow's joints in
miserable sort, drawing him out at length in an extraordinary
manner, he having only a pair of linen drawers
on his naked body. Then, they questioned him of a robbery
(the lieutenant being present and a clerk that
wrote), which not confessing, they put a higher horse
under the rope, to increase the torture and extension.
In this agony, confessing nothing, the executioner with
a horn (just such as they drench horses with) stuck the
end of it into his mouth, and poured the quantity of two
buckets of water down his throat and over him, which
so prodigiously swelled him, as would have pitied and
affrighted any one to see it; for all this, he denied all
that was charged to him. They then let him down, and
carried him before a warm fire to bring him to himself,
being now to all appearance dead with pain. What became
of him, I know not; but the gentleman whom he
robbed constantly averred him to be the man, and the
fellow's suspicious pale looks, before he knew he should
be racked, betrayed some guilt; the lieutenant was also
of that opinion, and told us at first sight (for he was a
lean, dry, black young man) he would conquer the torture;
and so it seems they could not hang him, but did
use in such cases, where the evidence is very presumptive,
to send them to the galleys, which is as bad as death.</p>

<p>There was another malefactor to succeed, but the
spectacle was so uncomfortable, that I was not able to
stay the sight of another. It represented yet to me the
intolerable sufferings which our Blessed Savior must needs
undergo, when his body was hanging with all its weight
upon the nails on the cross.</p>
