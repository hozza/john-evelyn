<p>We returned to Tours, from
whence, after nineteen weeks' sojourn, we traveled toward
the more southern part of France, minding now
to shape my course so, as I might winter in Italy. With
my friend, Mr. Thicknesse, and our guide, we went the
first day seven leagues to a castle called Chenonceau,
built by Catherine de Medicis, and now belonging to the
Duke de Vendôme, standing on a bridge. In the gallery,
among divers other excellent statues, is that of Scipio
Africanus, of oriental alabaster.</p>
