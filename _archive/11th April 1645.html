<p>St. Veronica's handkerchief (with
the impression of our Savior's face) was exposed, and
the next day the spear, with a world of ceremony. On
Holy Thursday, the Pope said mass, and afterward carried
the Host in procession about the chapel, with an
infinity of tapers. This finished, his Holiness was carried
in his open chair on men's shoulders to the place where,
reading the Bull <i>In Cœnâ Domini</i>, he both curses and
blesses all in a breath; then the guns are again fired.
Hence, he went to the Ducal hall of the Vatican, where
he washed the feet of twelve poor men, with almost the
same ceremony as it is done at Whitehall; they have clothes,
a dinner, and alms, which he gives with his own hands,
and serves at their table; they have also gold and silver
medals, but their garments are of white woolen long
robes, as we paint the Apostles. The same ceremonies
are done by the Conservators and other officers of state
at St. John di Lateran; and now the table on which
they say our blessed Lord celebrated his last supper is
set out, and the heads of the Apostles. In every famous
church they are busy in dressing up their pageantries to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
represent the Holy Sepulchre, of which we went to visit
divers.</p>

<p>On Good Friday, we went again to St. Peter's, where
the handkerchief, lance, and cross were all exposed, and
worshiped together. All the confession seats were filled
with devout people, and at night was a procession of several
who most lamentably whipped themselves till the blood
stained their clothes, for some had shirts, others upon
the bare back, having visors and masks on their faces;
at every three or four steps dashing the knotted and
raveled whip cord over their shoulders, as hard as they
could lay it on; while some of the religious orders and
fraternities sung in a dismal tone, the lights and crosses
going before, making all together a horrible and indeed
heathenish pomp.</p>

<p>The next day, there was much ceremony at St. John
di Laterano, so as the whole week was spent in running
from church to church, all the town in busy devotion,
great silence, and unimaginable superstition.</p>

<p>Easter day, I was awakened by the guns from St.
Angelo: we went to St. Peter's, where the Pope himself
celebrated mass, showed the relics before-named, and
gave a public Benediction.</p>

<p>Monday, we went to hear music in the Chiesa Nova;
and, though there were abundance of ceremonies at the
other great churches, and great exposure of relics, yet
being wearied with sights of this nature, and the season
of the year, summer, at Rome being very dangerous, by
reason of the heat minding us of returning northward,
we spent the rest of our time in visiting such places as
we had not yet sufficiently seen. Only I do not forget
the Pope's benediction of the <i>Gonfalone</i>, or Standard, and
giving the hallowed palms; and, on May Day, the great
procession of the University and the muleteers at St.
Anthony's, and their setting up a foolish May pole in the
Capitol, very ridiculous. We therefore now took coach a
little out of town, to visit the famous Roma Soterránea,
being much like what we had seen at St. Sebastians.
Here, in a cornfield, guided by two torches, we crept on
our bellies into a little hole, about twenty paces, which
delivered us into a large entry that led us into several
streets, or alleys, a good depth in the bowels of the earth,
a strange and fearful passage for divers miles, as Bosio<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
has measured and described them in his book. We ever
and anon came into pretty square rooms, that seemed to
be chapels with altars, and some adorned with very ordinary
ancient painting. Many skeletons and bodies are
placed on the sides one above the other in degrees like
shelves, whereof some are shut up with a coarse flat stone,
having engraven on them <i>Pro Christo</i>, or a cross and
palms, which are supposed to have been martyrs. Here,
in all likelihood, were the meetings of the Primitive
Christians during the persecutions, as Pliny the Younger
describes them. As I was prying about, I found a glass
phial, filled (as was conjectured) with dried blood, and
two lachrymatories. Many of the bodies, or rather bones
(for there appeared nothing else) lay so entire, as if
placed by the art of the chirurgeon, but being only
touched fell all to dust. Thus, after wandering two or
three miles in this subterranean meander, we returned
almost blind when we came into the daylight, and even
choked by the smoke of the torches. It is said that a
French bishop and his retinue adventuring too far into
these dens, their lights going out, were never heard of
more.</p>

<p>We were entertained at night with an English play at
the Jesuits', where we before had dined; and the next day
at Prince Galicano's, who himself composed the music to
a magnificent opera, where were present Cardinal Pamphilio,
the Pope's nephew, the Governors of Rome, the
cardinals, the ambassadors, ladies, and a number of nobility
and strangers. There had been in the morning a
joust and tournament of several young gentlemen on a
formal defy, to which we had been invited; the prizes
being distributed by the ladies, after the knight-errantry
way. The lancers and swordsmen running at tilt against
the barriers, with a great deal of clatter, but without
any bloodshed, giving much diversion to the spectators,
and was new to us travelers.</p>

<p>The next day Mr. Henshaw and I spent the morning in
attending the entrance and cavalcade of Cardinal Medici,
the ambassador from the Grand Duke of Florence, by the
Via Flaminia. After dinner, we went again to the Villa
Borghese, about a mile without the city; the garden is
rather a park, or a Paradise, contrived and planted with
walks and shades of myrtles, cypress, and other trees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and groves, with abundance of fountains, statues, and bass-relievos,
and several pretty murmuring rivulets. Here
they had hung large nets to catch woodcocks. There
was also a vivary, where, among other exotic fowls, was
an ostrich; besides a most capacious aviary; and, in another
inclosed part, a herd of deer. Before the palace
(which might become the court of a great prince) stands
a noble fountain, of white marble, enriched with statues.
The outer walls of the house are encrusted with excellent
antique bass-relievos, of the same marble, incornished
with festoons and niches set with statues from the foundation
to the roof. A stately portico joins the palace,
full of statues and columns of marble, urns, and other
curiosities of sculpture. In the first hall were the Twelve
Cæsars, of antique marble, and the whole apartments furnished
with pictures of the most celebrated masters, and
two rare tables of porphyry, of great value. But of this
already: for I often visited this delicious place.</p>

<p>This night were glorious fire-works at the palace of
Cardinal Medici before the gate, and lights of several
colors all about the windows through the city, which they
contrive by setting the candles in little paper lanterns
dyed with various colors, placing hundreds of them from
story to story; which renders a gallant show.</p>
