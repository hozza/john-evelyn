<p>This week died Conyers Seymour,
son of Sir Edward Seymour, killed in a duel caused by
a slight affront in St. James's Park, given him by one
who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a vain,
foppish young man, who made a great <i>éclât</i> about town
by his splendid equipage and boundless expense. He was
about twenty-three years old; his brother, now at Oxford,
inherited an estate of £7,000 a year, which had fallen to
him not two years before.</p>
