<p>I went to see the Pope's Palace,
the Vatican, where he for the most part keeps his Court.
It was first built by Pope Symmachus, and since augmented
to a vast pile of building by his successors. That part of
it added by Sextus V. is most magnificent. This leads us
into divers terraces arched <i>sub dio</i>, painted by Raphael
with the histories of the Bible, so esteemed, that artists
come from all parts of Europe to make their studies from
these designs. The foliage and grotesque about some of
the compartments are admirable. In another room are
represented at large, maps and plots of most countries in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the world, in vast tables, with brief descriptions. The
stairs which ascend out of St. Peter's portico into the
first hall, are rarely contrived for ease; these lead into
the hall of Gregory XIII., the walls whereof, half way to
the roof, are incrusted with most precious marbles of
various colors and works. So is also the pavement inlaid
work; but what exceeds description is, the <i>volta</i>, or roof
itself, which is so exquisitely painted, that it is almost
impossible for the skillfullest eyes to discern whether it be
the work of the pencil upon a flat, or of a tool cut deep
in stone. The <i>Rota dentata</i>, in this admirable perspective,
on the left hand as one goes out, the <i>Setella</i>, etc.,
are things of art incomparable. Certainly this is one of
the most superb and royal apartments in the world, much
too beautiful for a guard of gigantic Switzers, who do
nothing but drink and play at cards in it. Going up these
stairs is a painting of St. Peter, walking on the sea
toward our Savior.</p>

<p>Out of this I went into another hall, just before the
chapel, called the Sàla del Conclave, full of admirable
paintings; among others is the Assassination of Coligni,
the great [Protestant] French Admiral, murdered by the
Duke of Guise, in the Parisian massacre at the nuptials
of Henry IV, with Queen Margaret; under it is written,
"<i>Coligni et sociorum cædes</i>:" on the other side, "<i>Rex Coligi
necem probat</i>."</p>

<p>There is another very large picture, under which is
inscribed:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Alexander Papa III., Frederici Primi Imperatoris iram et impetum
fugiens, abdidit se Venetijs; cognitum et à senatu perhonorificè
susceptum, Othone Imperatoris filio navali prælio victo captoq; Fredericus,
pace facta, supplex adorat; fidem et obedientiam pollicitus. Ita
Pontifici sua dignitas Venet. Reip. beneficio restituta MCLXXVIII.</i>"<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24_24">24</a></p>

<p>This inscription I the rather took notice of, because
Urban VIII. had caused it to be blotted out during the
difference between him and that State; but it was now
restored and refreshed by his successor, to the great honor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of the Venetians. The Battle of Lepanto is another fair
piece here.</p>

<p>Now we came into the Pope's chapel, so much celebrated
for the Last Judgment painted by M. Angelo
Buonarotti. It is a painting in fresco, upon a dead wall
at the upper end of the chapel, just over the high altar,
of a vast design and miraculous fancy, considering the
multitude of naked figures and variety of posture. The
roof also is full of rare work. Hence, we went into
the <i>sacristia</i> where were showed all the most precious
vestments, copes, and furniture of the chapel. One
priestly cope, with the whole suite, had been sent from
one of our English Henrys, and is shown for a great
rarity. There were divers of the Pope's pantoufles that
are kissed on his foot, having rich jewels embroidered on
the instep, covered with crimson velvet; also his tiara,
or triple crown, divers miters, crosiers, etc., all bestudded
with precious stones, gold, and pearl, to a very great
value; a very large cross, carved (as they affirm) out of
the holy wood itself; numerous utensils of crystal, gold,
agate, amber, and other costly materials for the altar.</p>

<p>We then went into those chambers painted with the
Histories of the burning of Rome, quenched by the procession
of a Crucifix; the victory of Constantine over
Maxentius; St. Peter's delivery out of Prison; all by Julio
Romano, and are therefore called the Painters' Academy,
because you always find some young men or other designing
from them: a civility which is not refused in
Italy, where any rare pieces of the old and best masters
are extant, and which is the occasion of breeding up
many excellent men in that profession.</p>

<p>The Sala Clementina's Suffito is painted by Cherubin
Alberti, with an ample landscape of Paul Bril's.</p>

<p>We were then conducted into a new gallery, whose
sides were painted with views of the most famous places,
towns, and territories in Italy, rarely done, and upon the
roof the chief Acts of the Roman Church since St. Peter's
pretended See there. It is doubtless one of the
most magnificent galleries in Europe.—Out of this we
came into the Consistory, a noble room, the <i>volta</i> painted
in grotesque, as I remember. At the upper end, is an
elevated throne and a baldachin, or canopy of state, for
his Holiness, over it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>From thence, through a very long gallery (longer, I
think, than the French Kings at the Louvre), but only
of bare walls, we were brought into the Vatican Library.
This passage was now full of poor people, to each of
whom, in his passage to St. Peter's, the Pope gave a
<i>mezzo <a id="tn_png_165a"></a><!--TN: Period added after "grosse"-->grosse</i>. I believe they were in number near 1,500
or 2,000 persons.</p>

<p>This library is the most nobly built, furnished, and beautified
of any in the world; ample, stately, light, and cheerful,
looking into a most pleasant garden. The walls and
roof are painted, not with antiques and grotesques, like
our Bodleian at Oxford, but emblems, figures, diagrams,
and the like learned inventions, found out by the wit
and industry of famous men, of which there are now
whole volumes extant. There were likewise the effigies
of the most illustrious men of letters and fathers of the
church, with divers noble statues, in white marble, at
the entrance, <a id="tn_png_165"></a><!--TN: "viz." changed to "viz"-->viz, Hippolytus and Aristides. The General
Councils are painted on the side walls. As to the
ranging of the books, they are all shut up in presses of
wainscot, and not exposed on shelves to the open air,
nor are the most precious mixed among the more ordinary,
which are showed to the curious only; such are
those two Virgils written on parchment, of more than a
thousand years old; the like, a Terence; the "Acts of the
Apostles" in golden capital letters; Petrarch's "Epigrams,"
written with his own hand; also a Hebrew parchment,
made up in the ancient manner, from whence they were
first called "<i>Volumina</i>", with the Cornua; but what we
English do much inquire after, the book which our Henry
VIII. writ against Luther.<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25_25">25</a></p>

<p>The largest room is 100 paces long; at the end is the
gallery of printed books; then the gallery of the Duke of
Urban's library, in which are MSS. of remarkable minia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>ture,
and divers Chinese, Mexican, Samaritan, Abyssinian,
and other oriental books.</p>

<p>In another wing of the edifice, 200 paces long, were
all the books taken from Heidelberg, of which the learned
Gruter, and other great scholars, had been keepers.
These walls and <i>volte</i> are painted with representations of
the machines invented by Domenico Fontana for erection
of the obelisks; and the true design of Mahomet's sepulchre
at Mecca.</p>

<p>Out of this we went to see the Conclave, where, during
a vacancy, the Cardinals are shut up till they are agreed
upon a new election; the whole manner whereof was described
to us.</p>

<p>Hence we went into the Pope's Armory, under the
library. Over the door is this inscription:</p>

<p class="centerquot">"URBANUS VIII. LITTERIS ARMA, ARMA LITTERIS."</p>

<p>I hardly believe any prince in Europe is able to show a
more completely furnished library of Mars, for the quality
and quantity, which is 40,000 complete for horse and
foot, and neatly kept. Out of this we passed again by
the long gallery, and at the lower end of it down a very
large pair of stairs, round, without any steps as usually,
but descending with an evenness so ample and easy, that
a horse-litter, or coach, may with ease be drawn up; the
sides of the vacuity are set with columns: those at Amboise,
on the Loire, in France, are something of this
invention, but nothing so spruce. By these, we descended
into the Vatican gardens, called Belvedere, where
entering first into a kind of court, we were showed those
incomparable statues (so famed by Pliny and others) of
Laocoon with his three sons embraced by a huge serpent,
all of one entire Parian stone, very white and
perfect, somewhat bigger than the life, the work of those
three celebrated sculptors, Agesandrus, Polydorus, and
Artemidorus, Rhodians; it was found among the ruins of
Titus's baths, and placed here. Pliny says this statue is
to be esteemed before all pictures and statues in the
world; and I am of his opinion, for I never beheld anything
of art approach it. Here are also those two famous
images of Nilus with the children playing about him,
and that of Tiber; Romulus and Remus with the Wolf;
the dying Cleopatra; the Venus and Cupid, rare pieces;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the Mercury; <a id="tn_png_167"></a><!--TN: Semicolon added after "Cybel"-->Cybel; Hercules; Apollo; Antinous: most
of which are, for defense against the weather, shut up
in niches with wainscot doors. We were likewise showed
the relics of the Hadrian Moles, viz, the Pine, a vast
piece of metal which stood on the summit of that mausoleum;
also a peacock of copper, supposed to have been
part of <a id="tn_png_167a"></a><!--TN: "Scipio'o" changed to "Scipio's"-->Scipio's monument.</p>

<p>In the garden without this (which contains a vast circuit
of ground) are many stately fountains, especially two
casting water into antique lavers, brought from Titus's
baths; some fair grots and water-works, that noble cascade
where the ship dances, with divers other pleasant
inventions, walks, terraces, meanders, fruit trees, and a
most goodly prospect over the greatest part of the city.
One fountain under the gate I must not omit, consisting
of three jettos of water gushing out of the mouths or
proboscides of bees (the arms of the late Pope), because of
the inscription:</p>

<div class="centerpoem">
<div class="poem">
<span class="ia">"<i>Quid miraris Apem, quae mel de floribus haurit?</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Si tibi mellitam gutture fundit aquam.</i>"<br></span>
</div></div>
