<p>Scot, Scroop, Cook, and Jones,
suffered for reward of their iniquities at Charing Cross,
in sight of the place where they put to death their
natural prince, and in the presence of the King his son,
whom they also sought to kill. I saw not their execution,
but met their quarters, mangled, and cut, and
reeking, as they were brought from the gallows in baskets
on the hurdle. Oh, the miraculous providence of God!</p>
