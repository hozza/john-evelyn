<p>I went to see Paradise, a room
in Hatton Garden furnished with a representation of all
sorts of animals handsomely painted on boards or cloth,
and so cut out and made to stand, move, fly, crawl, roar,
and make their several cries. The man who showed it,
made us laugh heartily at his formal poetry.</p>
