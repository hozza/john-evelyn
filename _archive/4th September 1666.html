<p>The burning still rages, and it is
now gotten as far as the Inner Temple. All Fleet street,
the Old Bailey, Ludgate hill, Warwick lane, Newgate,
Paul's chain, Watling street, now flaming, and most of it
reduced to ashes; the stones of Paul's flew like grenados,
the melting lead running down the streets in a stream,
and the very pavements glowing with fiery redness, so
as no horse, nor man, was able to tread on them, and the
demolition had stopped all the passages, so that no help<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
could be applied. The eastern wind still more impetuously
driving the flames forward. Nothing but the
Almighty power of God was able to stop them; for vain
was the help of man.</p>
