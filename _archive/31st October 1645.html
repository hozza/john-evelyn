<p>Being my birthday, the nuns of
St. Catherine's sent me flowers of silkwork. We were
very studious all this winter till Christmas, when on
Twelfth-day, we invited all the English and Scots in
town to a feast, which sunk our excellent wine considerably.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VENICE</div>

<p>1645-46. In January, Signor Molino was chosen Doge
of Venice, but the extreme snow that fell, and the cold,
hindered my going to see the solemnity, so as I stirred
not from Padua till Shrovetide, when all the world repair
to Venice, to see the folly and madness of the Carnival;
the women, men, and persons of all conditions disguising
themselves in antique dresses, with extravagant music
and a thousand gambols, traversing the streets from house
to house, all places being then accessible and free to enter.
Abroad, they fling eggs filled with sweet water, but sometimes
not over-sweet. They also have a barbarous custom
of hunting bulls about the streets and piazzas, which is
very dangerous, the passages being generally narrow.
The youth of the several wards and parishes contend in
other masteries and pastimes, so that it is impossible to
recount the universal madness of this place during this
time of license. The great banks are set up for those
who will play at bassett; the comedians have liberty, and
the operas are open; witty pasquils are thrown about,
and the mountebanks have their stages at every corner.
The diversions which chiefly took me up was three noble
operas, where were excellent voices and music, the most
celebrated of which was the famous Anna Rencia, whom
we invited to a fish dinner after four days in Lent,
when they had given over at the theater. Accompanied
with an eunuch whom she brought with her, she entertained
us with rare music, both of them singing to a
harpsichord. It growing late, a gentleman of Venice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
came for her, to show her the galleys, now ready to sail
for Candia. This entertainment produced a second, given
us by the English consul of the merchants, inviting us
to his house, where he had the Genoese, the most celebrated
bass in Italy, who was one of the late opera band.
This diversion held us so late at night, that, conveying a
gentlewoman who had supped with us to her gondola at
the usual place of landing, we were shot at by two carbines
from another gondola, in which were a noble Venetian
and his courtesan unwilling to be disturbed, which
made us run in and fetch other weapons, not knowing
what the matter was, till we were informed of the danger
we might incur by pursuing it farther.</p>

<p>Three days after this, I took my leave of Venice, and
went to Padua, to be present at the famous anatomy
lecture, celebrated here with extraordinary apparatus,
lasting almost a whole month. During this time, I saw
a woman, a child, and a man dissected with all the manual
operations of the chirurgeon on the human body.
The one was performed by Cavalier Veslingius and Dr.
Jo. Athelsteninus Leon≈ìnas, of whom I purchased those
rare tables of veins and nerves, and caused him to prepare a
third of the lungs, liver, and nervi <i>sexti par</i>: with the gastric
veins, which I sent into England, and afterward presented
to the Royal Society, being the first of that kind that
had been seen there, and, for aught I know, in the world,
though afterward there were others. When the anatomy
lectures, which were in the mornings, were ended, I went
to see cures done in the hospitals; and certainly as there
are the greatest helps and the most skillful physicians, so
there are the most miserable and deplorable objects <a id="tn_png_245"></a><!--TN: Extra "to" removed-->to
exercise upon. Nor is there any, I should think, so
powerful an argument against the vice reigning in this
licentious country, as to be spectator of the misery these
poor creatures undergo. They are indeed very carefully
attended, and with extraordinary charity.</p>
