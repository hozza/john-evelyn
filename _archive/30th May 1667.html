<p>To London, to wait on the Duchess of
Newcastle (who was a mighty pretender to learning,
poetry, and philosophy, and had in both published divers
books) to the Royal Society, whither she came in great
pomp, and being received by our Lord President at the
door of our meeting-room, the mace, etc., carried before
him, had several experiments shown to her. I conducted
her Grace to her coach, and returned home.</p>
