<p>In the morning, I went with a French
gentleman, and my Lord Privy Seal to the House of
Lords, where we were placed by his Lordship next the
bar, just below the bishops, very commodiously both for
hearing and seeing. After a short space, came in the
Queen and Princess of Denmark, and stood next above
the archbishops, at the side of the House on the right
hand of the throne. In the interim, divers of the Lords,
who had not finished before, took the test and usual
oaths, so that her Majesty, the Spanish and other Ambassadors,
who stood behind the throne, heard the Pope and
the worship of the Virgin Mary, etc., renounced very
decently, as likewise the prayers which followed, standing
all the while. Then came in the King, the crown
on his head, and being seated, the Commons were introduced,
and the House being full, he drew forth a paper
containing his speech, which he read distinctly enough,
to this effect: "That he resolved to call a Parliament
from the moment of his brother's decease, as the best
means to settle all the concerns of the nation, so as to
be most easy and happy to himself and his subjects; that
he would confirm whatever he had said in his declaration
at the first Council concerning his opinion of the principles
of the Church of England, for their loyalty, and
would defend and support it, and preserve its government
as by law now established; that, as he would invade no
man's property, so he would never depart from his own
prerogative; and, as he had ventured his life in defense
of the nation, so he would proceed to do still; that, having
given this assurance of his care of our religion (his word
was YOUR religion) and property (which he had not said
by chance, but solemnly), so he doubted not of suitable
returns of his subjects' duty and kindness, especially as
to settling his revenue for life, for the many weighty
necessities of government, which he would not suffer to
be precarious; that some might possibly suggest that it
were better to feed and supply him from time to time
only, out of their inclination to frequent Parliaments;
but that that would be a very improper method to take
with him, since the best way to engage him to meet
oftener would be always to use him well, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
he expected their compliance speedily, that this session
being but short, they might meet again to satisfaction."</p>

<p>At every period of this, the House gave loud shouts.
Then he acquainted them with that morning's news of
Argyle's being landed in the West Highlands of Scotland
from Holland, and the treasonous declaration he had
published, which he would communicate to them, and
that he should take the best care he could it should meet
with the reward it deserved, not questioning the Parliament's
zeal and readiness to assist him as he desired; at
which there followed another "<i>Vive le Roi</i>," and so his
Majesty retired.</p>

<p>So soon as the Commons were returned and had put
themselves into a grand committee, they immediately put
the question, and unanimously voted the revenue to his
Majesty for life. Mr. Seymour made a bold speech against
many elections, and would have had those members who
(he pretended) were obnoxious, to withdraw, till they had
cleared the matter of their being legally returned; but no
one seconded him. The truth is, there were many of the
new members whose elections and returns were universally
censured, many of them being persons of no condition, or
interest, in the nation, or places for which they served,
especially in Devon, Cornwall, Norfolk, etc., said to have
been recommended by the Court, and from the effect of
the new charters changing the electors. It was reported
that Lord Bath carried down with him [into Cornwall]
no fewer than fifteen charters, so that some called him the
Prince Elector: whence Seymour told the House in his
speech that if this was digested, they might introduce what
religion and laws they pleased, and that though he never
gave heed to the fears and jealousies of the people before,
he was now really apprehensive of Popery. By the printed
list of members of 505, there did not appear to be above 135
who had been in former Parliaments, especially that lately
held at Oxford.</p>

<p>In the Lords' House, Lord Newport made an exception
against two or three young Peers, who wanted some
months, and some only four or five days, of being of age.</p>

<p>The Popish Lords, who had been sometime before released
from their confinement about the plot, were now
discharged of their impeachment, of which I gave Lord
Arundel of Wardour joy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Oates, who had but two days before been pilloried at
several places and whipped at the cart's tail from Newgate
to Aldgate, was this day placed on a sledge, being
not able to go by reason of so late scourging, and
dragged from prison to Tyburn, and whipped again all
the way, which some thought to be severe and extraordinary;
but, if he was guilty of the perjuries, and so of
the death of many innocents (as I fear he was), his
punishment was but what he deserved. I chanced to pass
just as execution was doing on him. A strange revolution!</p>

<p>Note: there was no speech made by the Lord Keeper
[Bridgman] after his Majesty, as usual.</p>

<p>It was whispered he would not be long in that situation,
and many believe the bold Chief Justice Jefferies,
who was made Baron of Wem, in Shropshire, and who
went thorough stitch in that tribunal, stands fair for that
office. I gave him joy the morning before of his new
honor, he having always been very civil to me.</p>
