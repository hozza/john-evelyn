<p>Being my birthday, and fifty-six
years old, I spent the morning in devotion and imploring
God's protection, with solemn thanksgiving for all his
signal mercies to me, especially for that escape which
concerned me this month at Blackwall. Dined with Mrs.
Godolphin, and returned home through a prodigious and
dangerous mist.</p>
