<p>This week there was a great change
of State officers. The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his
Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of Jersey, the Duke's
indisposition requiring his retreat. Mr. Vernon, Secretary
of State, was put out. The Seal was taken from the
Lord Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted
by a great majority of votes for what was charged against
him in the House of Commons. This being in term
time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty
of things in this fluctuating conjuncture. It is certain
that this Chancellor was a most excellent lawyer, very
learned in all polite literature, a superior pen, master of
a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor,
and most in place in this age did, to a more prodigious
excess than was ever known. But the Commons
had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring
kingdoms, that their jealousy made them cautious, and
every day strengthened the law which protected the people
from tyranny.</p>

<p>A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of
fruit of all kinds, and a propitious year.</p>
