<p>This evening, according to custom,
his Majesty opened the revels of that night by throwing
the dice himself in the privy chamber, where was a table
set on purpose, and lost his £100. (The year before he
won £1,500.) The ladies also played very deep. I came
away when the Duke of Ormond had won about £1,000,
and left them still at passage, cards, etc. At other
tables, both there and at the groom-porter's, observing
the wicked folly and monstrous excess of passion among
some losers; sorry am I that such a wretched custom as
play to that excess should be countenanced in a Court,
which ought to be an example of virtue to the rest of
the kingdom.</p>
