<p>I dined, together with Lord
Ossory and the Earl of Chesterfield, at the Portugal
Ambassador's, now newly come, at Cleveland House, a
noble palace, too good for that infamous.... The
staircase is sumptuous, and the gallery and garden; but,
above all, the costly furniture belonging to the Ambassador,
especially the rich Japan cabinets, of which I
think there were a dozen. There was a billiard table,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
with as many more hazards as ours commonly have; the
game being only to prosecute the ball till hazarded,
without passing the port, or touching the pin; if one
miss hitting the ball every time, the game is lost, or if
hazarded. It is more difficult to hazard a ball, though
so many, than in our table, by reason the bound is made
so exactly even, and the edges not stuffed; the balls are
also bigger, and they for the most part use the sharp
and small end of the billiard stick, which is shod with
brass, or silver. The entertainment was exceedingly civil;
but, besides a good olio, the dishes were trifling, hashed
and condited after their way, not at all fit for an English
stomach, which is for solid meat. There was yet good
fowls, but roasted to coal, nor were the sweetmeats good.</p>
