<p>I carried Lord Clarendon through
the city amid all the squibs and bacchanalia of the Lord
Mayor's show, to the Royal Society, where he was proposed
a member; and then treated him at dinner.</p>

<p>I went to St. Clement's, that prettily built and contrived
church where a young divine gave us an eloquent sermon
on 1 Cor. vi. 20, inciting to gratitude and glorifying
God for the fabric of our bodies and the dignity of
our nature.</p>
