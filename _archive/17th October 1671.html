<p>My Lord Henry Howard coming
this night to visit my Lord Chamberlain, and staying a
day, would needs have me go with him to Norwich, promising
to convey me back, after a day or two; this, as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
could not refuse, I was not hard to be pursuaded to, having
a desire to see that famous scholar and physician,
Dr. T. Browne, author of the "<i>Religio Medici</i>" and
"Vulgar Errors," now lately knighted. Thither, then,
went my Lord and I alone, in his flying chariot with six
horses; and by the way, discoursing with me of several
of his concerns, he acquainted me of his going to marry
his eldest son to one of the King's natural daughters, by
the Duchess of Cleveland; by which he reckoned he should
come into mighty favor. He also told me that, though
he kept that idle creature, Mrs. B——, and would leave
£200 a year to the son he had by her, he would never
marry her, and that the King himself had cautioned him
against it. All the world knows how he kept his promise,
and I was sorry at heart to hear what now he confessed
to me; and that a person and a family which I so much
honored for the sake of that noble and illustrious friend
of mine, his grandfather, should dishonor and pollute
them both with those base and vicious courses he of late
had taken since the death of Sir Samuel Tuke, and that
of his own virtuous lady (my Lady Anne Somerset, sister
to the Marquis); who, while they lived, preserved this
gentleman by their example and advice from those many
extravagances that impaired both his fortune and reputation.</p>

<p>Being come to the Ducal palace, my Lord made very
much of me; but I had little rest, so exceedingly desirous
he was to show me the contrivance he had made for the
entertainment of their Majesties, and the whole Court
not long before, and which, though much of it was but
temporary, apparently framed of boards only, was yet
standing. As to the palace, it is an old wretched building,
and that part of it newly built of brick, is very ill
understood; so as I was of the opinion it had been much
better to have demolished all, and set it up in a better
place, than to proceed any further; for it stands in the
very market-place, and, though near a river, yet a very
narrow muddy one, without any extent.</p>

<p>Next morning, I went to see Sir Thomas Browne (with
whom I had some time corresponded by letter, though I
had never seen him before); his whole house and garden
being a paradise and cabinet of <a id="tn_png_085"></a><!--TN: "rarites" changed to "rarities"-->rarities; and that of the
best collection, especially medals, books, plants, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
natural things. Among other curiosities, Sir Thomas had
a collection of the eggs of all the fowl and birds he could
procure, that country (especially the promontory of Norfolk)
being frequented, as he said, by several kinds
which seldom or never go further into the land, as cranes,
storks, eagles, and variety of water <a id="tn_png_086"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period added after "fowl"-->fowl. He led me
to see all the remarkable places of this ancient city, being
one of the largest, and certainly, after London, one of the
noblest of England, for its venerable cathedral, number
of stately churches, cleanness of the streets, and buildings
of flint so exquisitely headed and squared, as I was
much astonished at; but he told me they had lost the art
of squaring the flints, in which they so much excelled,
and of which the churches, best houses, and walls, are
built. The Castle is an antique extent of ground, which
now they call Marsfield, and would have been a fitting
area to have placed the Ducal palace in. The suburbs
are large, the prospects sweet, with other amenities, not
omitting the flower gardens, in which all the inhabitants
excel. The fabric of stuffs brings a vast trade to this
populous town.</p>

<p>Being returned to my Lord's, who had been with me
all this morning, he advised with me concerning a plot
to rebuild his house, having already, as he said, erected
a front next the street, and a left wing, and now resolving
to set up another wing and pavilion next the garden,
and to convert the bowling green into stables. My
advice was, to desist from all, and to meditate wholly on
rebuilding a handsome palace at Arundel House, in the
Strand, before he proceeded further here, and then to
place this in the Castle, that ground belonging to his
Lordship.</p>

<p>I observed that most of the church yards (though some
of them large enough) were filled up with earth, or rather
the congestion of dead bodies one upon another, for
want of earth, even to the very top of the walls, and
some above the walls, so as the churches seemed to be
built in pits.</p>
