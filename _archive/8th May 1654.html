<p>I went to Hackney, to see Lady Brook's
garden, which was one of the neatest and most celebrated
in England, the house well furnished, but a
despicable building. Returning, visited one Mr. Tomb's
garden; it has large and noble walks, some modern statues,
a vineyard, planted in strawberry borders, staked at ten
feet distances, the banqueting-house of cedar, where the
couch and seats were carved <i>à l'antique</i>; some good pictures
in the house, especially one of Vandyke's, being a
man in his shirt; also some of Stenwyck. I also called
at <a id="tn_png_315a"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period after "Mr"-->Mr. Ducie's, who has indeed a rare collection of the
best masters, and one of the largest stories of H. Hol<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>bein.
I also saw Sir Thomas Fowler's aviary, which is
a poor business.</p>
