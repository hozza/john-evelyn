<p>I went to London, to give the Lord
Ambassador Berkeley (now returned from the treaty at
Nimeguen) an account of the great trust reposed in me
during his absence, I having received and remitted to
him no less than Â£20,000 to my no small trouble and
loss of time, that during his absence, and when the
Lord Treasurer was no great friend [of his] I yet
procured him great sums, very often soliciting his
Majesty in his behalf; looking after the rest of his
estates and concerns entirely, without once accepting
any kind of acknowledgment, purely upon the request of
my dear friend, Mr. Godolphin. I returned with abundance
of thanks and professions from my Lord Berkeley
and my Lady.</p>
