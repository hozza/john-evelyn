<p>I went this afternoon with several
of the Royal Society to a supper which was all dressed,
both fish and flesh, in Monsieur Papin's digestors, by
which the hardest bones of beef itself, and mutton, were
made as soft as cheese, without water or other liquor,
and with less than eight ounces of coals, producing an
incredible quantity of gravy; and for close of all, a jelly
made of the bones of beef, the best for clearness and
good relish, and the most delicious that I had ever seen,
or tasted. We ate pike and other fish, bones and all,
without impediment; but nothing exceeded the pigeons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
which tasted just as if baked in a pie, all these being
stewed in their own juice, without any addition of water
save what swam about the digestor, as <i>in balneo</i>; the
natural juice of all these provisions acting on the grosser
substances, reduced the hardest bones to tenderness; but
it is best descanted with more particulars for extracting
tinctures, preserving and stewing fruit, and saving fuel,
in Dr. Papin's book, published and dedicated to our
Society of which he is a member. He is since gone to
Venice with the late Resident here (and also a member
of our Society), who carried this excellent mechanic,
philosopher, and physician, to set up a philosophical
meeting in that city. This philosophical supper caused
much mirth among us, and exceedingly pleased all the
company. I sent a glass of the jelly to my wife, to the
reproach of all that the ladies ever made of their best
hartshorn.<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_47_47">47</a></p>

<p>The season was unusually wet, with rain and thunder.</p>
