<p>Settling my domestic affairs in
order, blessed God for his infinite mercies and preservations
the past year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annus Mirabilis</span>, January 1st, 1659-60. Begging God's
blessings for the following year, I went to Exeter
Chapel, when Mr.Â Gunning began the year on Galatians
iv. 3-7, showing the love of Christ in shedding his
blood so early for us.</p>
