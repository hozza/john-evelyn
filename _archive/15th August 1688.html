<p>I went to Althorpe, in Northamptonshire,
seventy miles. A coach and four horses took
up me and my son at Whitehall, and carried us to Dunstable,
where we arrived and dined at noon, and from
thence another coach and six horses carried us to Althorpe,
four miles beyond Northampton, where we arrived
by seven o'clock that evening. Both these coaches
were hired for me by that noble Countess of Sunderland,
who invited me to her house at Althorpe, where she
entertained me and my son with very extraordinary kindness;
I stayed till the Thursday.</p>
