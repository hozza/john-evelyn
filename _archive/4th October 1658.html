<p>I dined with the Holland ambassador,
at Derby House: returning, I diverted to see a very
<span style="font-size:.8em;">WHITE RAVEN</span>, bred in Cumberland; also a porcupine, of
that kind that shoots its quills, of which see Claudian; it
was headed like a rat, the fore feet like a badger, the hind
feet like a bear.</p>
