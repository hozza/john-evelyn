<p>I again saw Prince George of Denmark:
he had the Danish countenance, blonde, of few
words, spoke French but ill, seemed somewhat heavy,
but reported to be valiant, and indeed he had bravely
rescued and brought off his brother, the King of Denmark,
in a battle against the Swedes, when both these
Kings were engaged very smartly.</p>
