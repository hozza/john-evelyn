<p>I went to Hampton Court to give his
Majesty thanks for his late gracious favor, though it was
but granting what was due. While I was in the Council
Chamber, came in some persons, at the head of whom
was a formal man with a large roll of parchment in his
hand, being an <span class="smcap">Address</span> (as he said, for he introduced
it with a speech) of the people of Coventry, giving his
Majesty their great acknowledgments for his granting a
liberty of conscience; he added that this was not the application
of one party only, but the unanimous address
of Church of England men, Presbyterians, Independents,
and Anabaptists, to show how extensive his Majesty's
grace was, as taking in all parties to his indulgence
and protection, which had removed all dissensions and
animosities, which would not only unite them in bonds
of Christian charity, but exceedingly encourage their
future industry, to the improvement of trade, and spreading
his Majesty's glory throughout the world; and that
now he had given to God his empire, God would establish
his; with expressions of great loyalty and submission;
and so he gave the roll to the King, which being returned
to him again, his Majesty caused him to read.
The address was short, but much to the substance of
the speech of their foreman, to whom the King, pulling
off his hat, said that what he had done in giving liberty
of conscience, was, what was ever his judgment ought to
be done; and that, as he would preserve them in their
enjoyment of it during his reign, so he would endeavor
to settle it by law, that it should never be altered by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
successors. After this, he gave them his hand to kiss.
It was reported the subscribers were above 1,000.</p>

<p>But this is not so remarkable as an address of the
week before (as I was assured by one present), of some
of the <span class="smcap">Family of Love</span>, His Majesty asked them what
this worship consisted in, and how many their party might
consist of; they told him their custom was to read the
Scripture, and then to preach; but did not give any further
account, only said that for the rest they were a sort
of refined Quakers, but their number very small, not consisting,
as they said, of above threescore in all, and those
chiefly belonging to the Isle of Ely.</p>
