<p>I went to Lambeth, with Sir R.
Browne's pretense to the Wardenship of Merton College,
Oxford, to which, as having been about forty years before
a student of that house, he was elected by the votes of
every Fellow except one; but the statutes of the house
being so that, unless every Fellow agree, the election
devolves to the Visitor, who is the Archbishop of Canterbury
(Dr. Juxon), his Grace gave his nomination to
Sir T. Clayton, resident there, and the Physic Professor:
for which I was not at all displeased, because, though
Sir Richard missed it by much ingratitude and wrong of
the Archbishop (Clayton being no Fellow), yet it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
have hindered Sir Richard from attending at Court to
settle his greater concerns, and so have prejudiced me,
though he was much inclined to have passed his time in
a collegiate life, very unfit for him at that time, for many
reasons. So I took leave of his Grace, who was formerly
Lord Treasurer in the reign of Charles I.</p>

<p>This afternoon, Prince Rupert showed me, with his own
hands, the new way of graving, called <i>mezzo tinto</i>, which
afterward, by his permission, I published in my "History
of Chalcography"; this set so many artists on work, that
they soon arrived to the perfection it is since come to,
emulating the tenderest miniatures.</p>

<p>Our Society now gave in my relation of the Peak of
Teneriffe, in the Great Canaries, to be added to more
queries concerning divers natural things reported of
that island.</p>

<p>I returned home with my Cousin, Tuke, now going for
France, as sent by his Majesty to condole the death of
that great Minister and politician, Count Mazarine.</p>
