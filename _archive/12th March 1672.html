<p>Now was the first blow given by
us to the Dutch convoy of the Smyrna fleet, by Sir Robert
Holmes and Lord Ossory, in which we received little
save blows, and a worthy reproach for attacking our
neighbors ere any war was proclaimed, and then pretending
the occasion to be, that some time before, the
Merlin yacht chancing to sail through the whole Dutch
fleet, their Admiral did not strike to that trifling vessel.
Surely, this was a quarrel slenderly grounded, and not
becoming Christian neighbors. We are likely to thrive,
accordingly. Lord Ossory several times deplored to me
his being engaged in it; he had more justice and honor
than in the least to approve of it, though he had been
over-persuaded to the expedition. There is no doubt but
we should have surprised this exceeding rich fleet, had
not the avarice and ambition of Holmes and Spragge
separated themselves, and willfully divided our fleet, on
presumption that either of them was strong enough to
deal with the Dutch convoy without joining and mutual
help; but they so warmly plied our divided fleets, that
while in conflict the merchants sailed away, and got safe
into Holland.</p>

<p>A few days before this, the Treasurer of the Household,
Sir Thomas Clifford, hinted to me, as a confidant,
that his Majesty would <span class="small">SHUT UP THE EXCHEQUER</span> (and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
accordingly, his Majesty made use of infinite treasure
there, to prepare for an intended rupture); but, says he,
it will soon be open again, and everybody satisfied; for
this bold man, who had been the sole adviser of the
King to invade that sacred stock (though some pretend
it was Lord Ashley's counsel, then Chancellor of the
Exchequer), was so over-confident of the success of this
unworthy design against the Smyrna merchants, as to
put his Majesty on an action which not only lost the
hearts of his subjects, and ruined many widows and
orphans, whose stocks were lent him, but the reputation
of his Exchequer forever, it being before in such credit,
that he might have commanded half the wealth of the nation.</p>

<p>The credit of this bank being thus broken, did exceedingly
discontent the people, and never did his Majesty's
affairs prosper to any purpose after it, for as it did not
supply the expense of the meditated war, so it melted
away, I know not how.</p>

<p>To this succeeded the King's declaration for an universal
toleration; Papists and swarms of Sectaries, now
boldly showing themselves in their public meetings. This
was imputed to the same council, Clifford warping to
Rome as was believed, nor was Lord Arlington clear of
suspicion, to gratify that party, but as since it has proved,
and was then evidently foreseen, to the extreme weakening
of the Church of England and its Episcopal Government,
as it was projected. I speak not this as my own
sense, but what was the discourse and thoughts of others,
who were lookers-on; for I think there might be some
relaxations without the least prejudice to the present
establishment, discreetly limited, but to let go the reins
in this manner, and then to imagine they could take
them up again as easily, was a false policy, and greatly
destructive. The truth is, our Bishops slipped the occasion;
for, had they held a steady hand upon his Majesty's
restoration, as they might easily have done, the Church
of England had emerged and flourished, without interruption;
but they were then remiss, and covetous after
advantages of another kind while his Majesty suffered
them to come into a harvest, with which, without any
injustice he might have remunerated innumerable gallant
gentlemen for their services who had ruined themselves
in the late rebellion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
