<p>I dined at the Comptroller's [of
the Household] with the Earl of Oxford and Mr.Â Ashburnham;
it was said it should be the last of the public
diets, or tables, at Court, it being determined to put
down the old hospitality, at which was great murmuring,
considering his Majesty's vast revenue and the plenty of
the nation. Hence, I went to sit in a Committee, to
consider about the regulation of the Mint at the Tower;
in which some small progress was made.</p>
