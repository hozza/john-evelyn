<p>Dined with me Sir Alexander Fraser,
prime physician to his Majesty; afterward, went on board
his Majesty's pleasure-boat, when I saw the London frigate
launched, a most stately ship, built by the City to supply
that which was burnt by accident some time since; the
King, Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, being there with great
banquet.</p>
