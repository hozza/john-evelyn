<p>I went to Thetford, to the
borough-town, where stand the ruins of a religious house:
there is a round mountain artificially raised, either for
some castle, or monument, which makes a pretty landscape.
As we went and returned, a tumbler showed his
extraordinary address in the Warren. I also saw the
Decoy; much pleased with the stratagem.</p>
