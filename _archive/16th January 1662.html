<p>Having notice of the Duke of
York's intention to visit my poor habitation and garden
this day, I returned, when he was pleased to do me that
honor of his own accord, and to stay some time viewing
such things as I had to entertain his curiosity. Afterward
he caused me to dine with him at the Treasurer of the
Navy's house, and to sit with him covered at the same
table. There were his Highness, the Duke of Ormond,
and several Lords. Then they viewed some of my
grounds about a project for a receptacle for ships to be
moored in, which was laid aside as a fancy of Sir Nicholas

East India vessel that lay at Blackwall, where we had
entertainment of several curiosities. Among other spirituous
drinks, as punch, etc., they gave us Canary that
had been carried to and brought from the Indies, which
was indeed incomparably good. I returned to London
with his Highness. This night was acted before his
Majesty "The Widow," a lewd play.</p>
