<p>Came my Lady Sunderland, to desire
that I would propose a match to Sir Stephen Fox for
her son, Lord Spencer, to marry Mrs. Jane, Sir Stephen's
daughter. I excused myself all I was able; for the truth
is, I was afraid he would prove an extravagant man: for,
though a youth of extraordinary parts, and had an excellent
education to render him a worthy man, yet his early
inclinations to extravagance made me apprehensive, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
I should not serve Sir Stephen by proposing it, like a
friend; this being now his only daughter, well-bred, and
likely to receive a large share of her father's opulence.
Lord Sunderland was much sunk in his estate by gaming
and other prodigalities, and was now no longer Secretary
of State, having fallen into displeasure of the King for siding
with the Commons about the succession; but which,
I am assured, he did not do out of his own inclination,
or for the preservation of the Protestant religion, but by
mistaking the ability of the party to carry it. However,
so earnest and importunate was the Countess, that I did
mention it to Sir Stephen, who said it was too great an
honor, that his daughter was very young, as well as my
Lord, and he was resolved never to marry her without
the parties' mutual liking; with other objections which I
neither would or could contradict. He desired me to express
to the Countess the great sense he had of the honor
done him, that his daughter and her son were too young,
that he would do nothing without her liking, which he
did not think her capable of expressing judiciously, till
she was sixteen or seventeen years of age, of which she
now wanted four years, and that I would put it off as
civilly as I could.</p>
