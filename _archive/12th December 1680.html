<p>This evening, looking out of my
chamber window toward the west, I saw a meteor of an
obscure bright color, very much in shape like the blade
of a sword, the rest of the sky very serene and clear.
What this may portend, God only knows; but such another
phenomenon I remember to have seen in 1640, about
the trial of the great Earl of Strafford, preceding our
bloody Rebellion. I pray God avert his judgments! We
have had of late several comets, which though I believe
appear from natural causes, and of themselves operate
not, yet I cannot despise <a id="tn_png_170"></a><!--TN: Period added after "them"-->them. They may be warnings
from God, as they commonly are forerunners of his
animadversions. After many days and nights of snow,
cloudy and dark weather, the comet was very much wasted.</p>
