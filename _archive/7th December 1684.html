<p>I went to see the new church at
St. James's, elegantly built; the altar was especially
adorned, the white marble inclosure curiously and richly
carved, the flowers and garlands about the walls by
Mr. Gibbons, in wood: a pelican with her young at
her breast; just over the altar in the carved compartment
and border environing the purple velvet fringed
with I. H. S. richly embroidered, and most noble plate,
were given by Sir R. Geere, to the value (as was said)
of £200. There was no altar anywhere in England, nor
has there been any abroad, more handsomely adorned.</p>
