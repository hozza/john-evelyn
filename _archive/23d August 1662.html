<p>I was spectator of the most magnificent
triumph that ever floated on the Thames, considering
the innumerable boats and vessels, dressed and
adorned with all imaginable pomp, but, above all, the
thrones, arches, pageants, and other representations,
stately barges of the Lord Mayor and companies, with
various inventions, music, and peals of ordnance both
from the vessels and the shore, going to meet and conduct
the new Queen from Hampton Court to Whitehall,
at the first time of her coming to town. In my opinion,
it far exceeded all the Venetian Bucentoras, etc., on the
Ascension, when they go to espouse the Adriatic. His
Majesty and the Queen came in an antique-shaped open
vessel, covered with a state, or canopy, of cloth of gold,
made in form of a cupola, supported with high Corinthian
pillars, wreathed with flowers, festoons and garlands. I
was in our newly built vessel, sailing among them.</p>
