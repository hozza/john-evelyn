<p>My daughter Evelyn going in
the coach to visit in the city, a jolt (the door being not
fast shut) flung her quite out in such manner, as the
hind wheels passed over her a little above her knees.
Yet it pleased God, besides the bruises of the wheels,
she had no other harm. In two days she was able to
walk, and soon after perfectly well; through God Almighty's
great mercy to an excellent wife and a most
dutiful and discreet daughter-in-law.</p>
