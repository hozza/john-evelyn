<p>A large whale was taken between my
land abutting on the Thames and Greenwich, which
drew an infinite concourse to see it, by water, horse,
coach, and on foot, from London, and all parts. It
appeared first below Greenwich at low water, for at high
water it would have destroyed all the boats, but lying
now in shallow water encompassed with boats, after a
long conflict, it was killed with a harping iron, struck
in the head, out of which spouted blood and water
by two tunnels; and after a horrid groan, it ran quite
on shore, and died. Its length was fifty-eight feet,
height sixteen; black skinned, like coach leather; very
small eyes, great tail, only two small fins, a peaked
snout and a mouth so wide, that divers men might have
stood upright in it; no teeth, but sucked the slime only
as through a grate of that bone which we call whalebone;
the throat yet so narrow, as would not have admitted
the least of fishes. The extremes of the cetaceous
bones hang downward from the upper jaw, and are hairy
toward the ends and bottom within side: all of it prodigious;
but in nothing more wonderful than that an
animal of so great a bulk should be nourished only by
slime through those grates.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>
