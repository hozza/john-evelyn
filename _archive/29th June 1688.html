nine in the morning to past six in the evening, when the
jury retired to consider of their verdict, and the Court
adjourned to nine the next morning. The jury were
locked up till that time, eleven of them being for an acquittal;
but one (Arnold, a brewer) would not consent.
At length he agreed with the others. The Chief Justice,
Wright, behaved with great moderation and civility to the
Bishops. Alibone, a Papist, was strongly against them;
but Holloway and Powell being of opinion in their favor,
they were acquitted. When this was heard, there was
great rejoicing; and there was a lane of people from the
King's Bench to the water side, on their knees, as the
Bishops passed and repassed, to beg their blessing. Bonfires
were made that night, and bells rung, which was
taken very ill at Court, and an appearance of nearly sixty
Earls and Lords, etc., on the bench, did not a little comfort
them; but indeed they were all along full of comfort
and cheerful.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

(Hales, who used them very surlily), any fees, alleging
that none were due.</p>

<p>The night was solemnized with bonfires, and other fireworks,
etc.</p>
