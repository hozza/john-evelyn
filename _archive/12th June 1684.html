<p>I went to advise and give directions
about the building of two streets in Berkeley Garden, reserving
the house and as much of the garden as the
breadth of the house. In the meantime, I could not but
deplore that sweet place (by far the most noble gardens,
courts, and accommodations, stately porticos, etc., anywhere
about the town) should be so much straitened
and turned into tenements. But that magnificent pile
and gardens contiguous to it, built by the late Lord
Chancellor Clarendon, being all demolished, and designed
for piazzas and buildings, was some excuse for my Lady
Berkeley's resolution of letting out her ground also for
so excessive a price as was offered, advancing near
Â£1,000 per annum in mere ground rents; to such a mad
intemperance was the age come of building about a city,
by far too disproportionate already to the nation:<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_53_53">53</a> I having
in my time seen it almost as large again as it was
within my memory.</p>
