<p>Came my Lord Cornbury, Sir William
Pulteney, and others to visit me. I went this evening to
London, to carry Mr. Pepys to my brother Richard, now
exceedingly afflicted with the stone, who had been successfully
cut, and carried the stone as big as a tennis
ball to show him, and encourage his resolution to go
through the operation.</p>
