<p>To see Sir Robert Needham,
at Lambeth, a relation of mine; and thence to John Tradescant's
museum, in which the chiefest rarities were, in
my opinion, the ancient Roman, Indian, and other nations'
armor, shields, and weapons; some habits of curiously-colored
and wrought feathers, one from the phœnix
wing, as tradition goes. Other innumerable things there
were printed in his catalogue by Mr. Ashmole, to whom
after the death of the widow they are bequeathed, and by
him designed as a gift to Oxford.</p>
