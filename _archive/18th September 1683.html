<p>I went to London to visit the
Duchess of Grafton, now great with child, a most virtuous
and beautiful lady. Dining with her at my Lord
Chamberlain's, met my Lord of St. Alban's, now grown
so blind, that he could not see to take his meat. He has
lived a most easy life, in plenty even abroad, while his
Majesty was a sufferer; he has lost immense sums at play,
which yet, at about eighty years old, he continues, having
one that sits by him to name the spots on the cards.
He ate and drank with extraordinary appetite. He is a
prudent old courtier, and much enriched since his Majesty's
return.</p>

<p>After dinner, I walked to survey the sad demolition of
Clarendon House, that costly and only sumptuous palace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
of the late Lord Chancellor Hyde, where I have often
been so cheerful with him, and sometimes so sad: happening
to make him a visit but the day before he fled
from the angry Parliament, accusing him of maladministration,
and being envious at his grandeur, who from a
private lawyer came to be father-in-law to the Duke of
York, and as some would suggest, designing his Majesty's
marriage with the Infanta of Portugal, not apt to breed.
To this they imputed much of our unhappiness; and that
he, being sole minister and favorite at his Majesty's
restoration, neglected to gratify the King's suffering
party, preferring those who were the cause of our troubles.
But perhaps as many of these things were injuriously
laid to his charge, so he kept the government far steadier
than it has proved since. I could name some who I
think contributed greatly to his ruin,—the buffoons and
the <span class="small">MISSIS</span>, to whom he was an eye-sore. It is true he
was of a jolly temper, after the old English fashion; but
France had now the ascendant, and we were become
quite another nation. The Chancellor gone, and dying
in exile, the Earl his successor sold that which cost
£50,000 building, to the young Duke of Albemarle for
£25,000, to pay debts which how contracted remains yet
a mystery, his son being no way a prodigal. Some
imagine the Duchess his daughter had been chargeable
to him. However it were, this stately palace is decreed
to ruin, to support the prodigious waste the Duke of
Albemarle had made of his estate, since the old man died.
He sold it to the highest bidder, and it fell to certain
rich bankers and mechanics, who gave for it and the
ground about it, £35,000; they design a new town, as it
were, and a most magnificent piazza [square]. It is said
they have already materials toward it with what they
sold of the house alone, more worth than what they paid
for it. See the vicissitudes of earthly things! I was
astonished at this demolition, nor less at the little army
of laborers and artificers leveling the ground, laying
foundations, and contriving great buildings at an expense
of £200,000, if they perfect their design.</p>
