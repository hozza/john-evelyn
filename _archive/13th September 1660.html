<p>I saw in Southwark, at St.
Margaret's fair, monkeys and apes dance, and do other
feats of activity on the high rope; they were gallantly
clad <i>รก la monde</i>, went upright, saluted the company,
bowing and pulling off their hats; they saluted one
another with as good a grace as if instructed by a
dancing master; they turned heels over head with a basket
having eggs in it, without breaking any; also, with
lighted candles in their hands, and on their heads, without
extinguishing them, and with vessels of water
without spilling a drop. I also saw an Italian wench
dance, and perform all the tricks on the high rope to
admiration; all the Court went to see her. Likewise,
here was a man who took up a piece of iron cannon of
about 400lb. weight with the hair of his head only.</p>
