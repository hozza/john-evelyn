<p>Dr. Sprat, now made Dean of
Westminster, preached to the King at Whitehall, on Matt.
vi. 24. Recollecting the passages of the past year, I gave
God thanks for his mercies, praying his blessing for the
future.</p>

<p>1st January, 1683-84. The weather continuing intolerably
severe, streets of booths were set up on the Thames;
the air was so very cold and thick, as of many years there
had not been the like. The smallpox was very mortal.</p>
