<p>I went to visit Mr. Hyldiard, at
his house at Horsley (formerly the great Sir Walter
Raleigh's<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_47_47">47</a>), where met me Mr. Oughtred, the famous
mathematician; he showed me a box, or golden case, of
divers rich and aromatic balsams, which a chemist, a
scholar of his, had sent him out of Germany.</p>
