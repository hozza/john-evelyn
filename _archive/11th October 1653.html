<p>My son, John Stansfield, was born,
being my second child, and christened by the name of
my mother's father, that name now quite extinct,
being of Cheshire. Christened by Mr.Â Owen, in my
library, at Sayes Court, where he afterward churched my
wife, I always making use of him on these occasions, because
the parish minister dared not have officiated according
to the form and usage of the Church of England,
to which I always adhered.</p>
