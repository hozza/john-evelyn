<p>To Chatham; and, 1st July, to the
fleet with Lord Sandwich, now Admiral, with whom I
went in a pinnace to the Buoy of the Nore, where the
whole fleet rode at anchor; went on board the Prince, of
ninety brass ordnance, haply the best ship in the world,
both for building and sailing; she had 700 men. They
made a great huzza, or shout, at our approach, three
times. Here we dined with many noblemen, gentlemen,
and volunteers, served in plate and excellent meat of all
sorts. After dinner, came his Majesty, the Duke, and
Prince Rupert. Here I saw the King knight Captain
Custance for behaving so bravely in the late fight. It
was surprising to behold the good order, decency, and
plenty of all things in a vessel so full of men. The ship
received a hundred cannon shot in her body. Then I
went on board the Charles, to which after a gun was shot
off, came all the flag officers to his Majesty, who there
held a General Council, which determined that his Royal
Highness should adventure himself no more this summer.
I came away late, having seen the most glorious fleet that
ever spread sails. We returned in his Majesty's yacht
with my Lord Sandwich and Mr. Vice-Chamberlain, landing
at Chatham on Sunday morning.</p>
