<p>Went to London to see the
entrance of the Russian Ambassador, whom his Majesty
ordered to be received with much state, the Emperor not
only having been kind to his Majesty in his distress,
but banishing all commerce with our nation during the
Rebellion.</p>

<p>First, the city companies and trained bands were all
in their stations: his Majesty's army and guards in
great order. His Excellency came in a very rich coach,
with some of his chief attendants; many of the rest on
horseback, clad in their vests, after the Eastern manner,
rich furs, caps, and carrying the presents, some carrying
hawks, furs, teeth, bows, etc. It was a very magnificent
show.</p>

<p>I dined with the Master of the Mint, where was old
Sir Ralph Freeman;<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_74_74">74</a> passing my evening at the Queen-Mother's
Court; at night, saw acted "The Committee,"
a ridiculous play of Sir R. Howard, where the mimic,
Lacy, acted the Irish footman to admiration.</p>

Dean of Westminster to his consecration dinner and ceremony,
on his being made Bishop of <a id="tn_png_401a"></a><!--TN: Period added after "Worcester"-->Worcester. Dr.
Bolton preached in the Abbey Church; then followed the
consecration by the Bishops of London, Chichester, Winchester,
Salisbury, etc. After this, was one of the most
plentiful and magnificent dinners that in my life I ever
saw; it cost near Â£600 as I was informed. Here were the
judges, nobility, clergy, and gentlemen innumerable, this
Bishop being universally beloved for his sweet and gentle
disposition. He was author of those Characters which go
under the name of Blount. He translated his late Majesty's
"Icon" into Latin, was Clerk of his Closet, Chaplain,
Dean of Westminster, and yet a most humble, meek, and
cheerful man, an excellent scholar, and rare preacher. I
had the honor to be loved by him. He married me at
Paris, during his Majesty's and the Church's exile. When
I took leave of him, he brought me to the cloisters in
his episcopal habit. I then went to prayers at Whitehall,
where I passed that evening.</p>
