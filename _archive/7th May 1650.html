<p>I went with Sir Richard Browne's lady
and my wife, together with the Earl of Chesterfield, Lord
Ossory and his brother, to Vamber, a place near the city
famous for butter; when, coming homeward, being on
foot, a quarrel arose between Lord Ossory and a man in
a garden, who thrust Lord Ossory from the gate with
uncivil language; on which our young gallants struck the
fellow on the pate, and bade him ask pardon, which he
did with much submission, and so we parted. But we
were not gone far before we heard a noise behind us, and
saw people coming with guns, swords, staves, and forks,
and who followed, flinging stones; on which, we turned, and
were forced to engage, and with our swords, stones, and
the help of our servants (one of whom had a pistol) made
our retreat for near a quarter of a mile, when we took
shelter in a house, where we were besieged, and at length
forced to submit to be prisoners. Lord Hatton, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
some others, were taken prisoners in the flight, and his
lordship was confined under three locks and as many
doors in this rude fellow's master's house, who pretended
to be steward to Monsieur St. Germain, one of the presidents
of the Grand Chambre du Parlement, and a Canon of NÃ´tre
Dame. Several of us were much hurt. One of our lackeys
escaping to Paris, caused the bailiff of St. Germain
to come with his guard and rescue us. Immediately
afterward, came Monsieur St. Germain himself, in great
wrath, on hearing that his housekeeper was assaulted;
but when he saw the King's officers, the gentlemen and
noblemen, with his Majesty's Resident and understood
the occasion, he was ashamed of the accident, requesting
the fellow's pardon, and desiring the ladies to accept their
submission and a supper at his house. It was ten o'clock
at night ere we got to Paris, guarded by Prince Griffith
(a Welsh hero going under that name, and well known
in England for his extravagancies), together with the
scholars of two academies, who came forth to assist and
meet us on horseback, and would fain have alarmed the
town we received the affront from: which, with much ado,
we prevented.</p>
