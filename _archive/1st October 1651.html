<p>The Dean of Peterborough [Dr.
Cosin] preached on Job xiii., verse 15, encouraging our
trust in God on all events and extremities, and for establishing
and comforting some ladies of great quality, who
were then to be discharged from our Queen-Mother's
service unless they would go over to the Romish Mass.</p>

<p>The Dean, dining this day at our house, told me the
occasion of publishing those Offices, which among the
Puritans were wont to be called <span class="smcap">Cosin's cozening Devotions</span>,
by way of derision. At the first coming of the
Queen into England, she and her French ladies were
often upbraiding our religion, that had neither appointed
nor set forth any hours of prayer, or breveries, by which
ladies and courtiers, who have much spare time, might
edify and be in devotion, as they had. Our Protestant
ladies, scandalized it seems at this, moved the matter to
the King; whereupon his Majesty presently called Bishop
White to him and asked his thoughts of it, and whether
there might not be found some forms of prayer proper
on such occasions, collected out of some already approved
forms, that so the court ladies and others (who spent
much time in trifling) might at least appear as devout,
and be so too, as the new-come-over French ladies, who
took occasion to reproach our want of zeal and religion.
On which, the Bishop told his Majesty that it might be
done easily, and was very necessary; whereupon the
King commanded him to employ some person of the
clergy to compile such a Work, and presently the Bishop
naming Dr. Cosin, the King enjoined him to charge the
Doctor in his name to set about it immediately. This
the Dean told me he did; and three months after, bringing
the book to the King, he commanded the Bishop of
London to read it over, and make his report; this was so
well liked, that (contrary to former custom of doing it
by a chaplain) he would needs give it an <i>imprimatur</i>
under his own hand. Upon this there were at first only
200 copies printed; nor, said he, was there anything in
the whole book of my own composure, nor did I set any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
name as author to it, but those necessary prefaces, etc.,
out of the Fathers, touching the times and seasons of
prayer; all the rest being entirely translated and collected
out of an <span class="smcap">Office</span> published by authority of Queen
Elizabeth, anno 1560, and our own Liturgy. This I
rather mention to justify that industrious and pious
Dean, who had exceedingly suffered by it, as if he had
done it of his own head to introduce Popery, from which
no man was more averse, and one who in this time of
temptation and apostacy held and confirmed many to our
Church.</p>
