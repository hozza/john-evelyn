<p>Complaint being come to the Queen
and Court of France of the affront we had received, the
President was ordered to ask pardon of Sir R. Browne,
his Majesty's Resident, and the fellow to make submission,
and be dismissed. There came along with him the
President de Thou, son of the great Thuanus [the historian],
and so all was composed. But I have often heard
that gallant gentleman, my Lord Ossory, affirm solemnly
that in all the conflicts he was ever in at sea or on land
(in the most desperate of both which he had often been),
he believed he was never in so much danger as when
these people rose against us. He used to call it the
<i>bataile de Vambre</i>, and remember it with a great deal of
mirth as an adventure, <i>en cavalier</i>.</p>
