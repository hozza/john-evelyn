<p>I went with my Lord Chamberlain to
see a garden, at Enfield town; thence, to Mr. Secretary
Coventry's lodge in the Chase. It is a very pretty place,
the house commodious, the gardens handsome, and our
entertainment very free, there being none but my
Lord and myself. That which I most wondered at was,
that, in the compass of twenty-five miles, yet within
fourteen of London, there is not a house, barn, church,
or building, besides three lodges. To this Lodge are
three great ponds, and some few inclosures, the rest a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
solitary desert, yet stored with no less than 3,000 deer.
These are pretty retreats for gentlemen, especially for
those who are studious and lovers of privacy.</p>

<p>We returned in the evening by Hampstead, to see
Lord Wotton's house and garden (Bellsize House), built
with vast expense by Mr. O'Neale, an Irish gentleman
who married Lord Wotton's mother, Lady Stanhope.
The furniture is very particular for Indian cabinets, porcelain,
and other solid and noble movables. The gallery
very fine, the gardens very large, but ill kept, yet
woody and <a id="tn_png_124"></a><!--TN: Period added after "chargeable"-->chargeable. The soil a cold weeping clay,
not answering the expense.</p>
