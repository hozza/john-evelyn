<p>The Earl of Norwich came as Ambassador
extraordinary: I went to meet him in a coach and
six horses, at the palace of Monsieur de Bassompi√®re,
where I saw that gallant person, his gardens, terraces, and
rare prospects. My lord was waited on by the master of
the ceremonies, and a very great cavalcade of men of
quality, to the Palais Cardinal, where on the 23d he had
audience of the French king, and the queen Regent his
mother, in the golden chamber of presence. From thence,
I conducted him to his lodgings in Rue St. Denis, and
so took my leave.</p>
