<p>We went to Beverley, a large town
with two stately churches, St. John's and St. Mary's, not
much inferior to the best of our cathedrals. Here a
very old woman showed us the monuments, and, being
above 100 years of age, spoke the language of Queen
Mary's days, in whose time she was born; she was
widow of a sexton who had belonged to the church a
hundred years.</p>

<p>Hence, we passed through a fenny but rich country to
Hull, situated like Calais, modernly and strongly fortified
with three block-houses of brick and earth. It has a
good market place and harbor for ships. Famous also
(or rather infamous) is this town for Hotham's refusing
entrance to his Majesty. The water-house is worth seeing.
And here ends the south of Yorkshire.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>
