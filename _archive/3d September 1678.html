<p>I went to London, to dine with
Mrs. Godolphin, and found her in labor; she was brought
to bed of a son, who was baptized in the chamber, by
the name of Francis, the susceptors being Sir William
Godolphin (head of the family), Mr. John Hervey, Treasurer
to the Queen, and Mrs. Boscawen, sister to Sir
William and the father.</p>
