<p>I dined at Arundel House, where
I heard excellent music performed by the ablest masters,
both French and English, on theorbos, viols, organs,
and voices, as an exercise against the coming of the
Queen, purposely composed for her chapel. Afterward,
my Lord Aubigny (her Majesty's Almoner to be) showed
us his elegant lodging, and his wheel-chair for ease and
motion, with divers other curiosities; especially a kind
of artificial glass, or porcelain, adorned with relievos of
paste, hard and beautiful. Lord Aubigny (brother to
the Duke of Lennox) was a person of good sense, but
wholly abandoned to ease and effeminacy.</p>

<p>I received of Sir Peter Ball, the Queen's attorney, a
draft of an Act against the nuisance of the smoke of
London, to be reformed by removing several trades
which are the cause of it, and endanger the health of
the King and his people. It was to have been offered
to the Parliament, as his Majesty commanded.</p>
