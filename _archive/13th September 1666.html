<p>I presented his Majesty with a
survey of the ruins, and a plot for a new city, with a
discourse on it; whereupon, after dinner, his Majesty sent
for me into the Queen's bed-chamber, her Majesty and
the Duke only being present. They examined each particular,
and discoursed on them for near an hour, seeming
to be extremely pleased with what I had so early thought
on. The Queen was now in her cavalier riding-habit,
hat and feather, and horseman's coat, going to take
the air.</p>
