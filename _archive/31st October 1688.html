<p>My birthday, being the 68th year
of my age. O blessed Lord, grant that as I grow in
years, so may I improve in grace! Be thou my protector
this following year, and preserve me and mine
from those dangers and great confusions that threaten a
sad revolution to this sinful nation! Defend thy church,
our holy religion, and just laws, disposing his Majesty
to listen to sober and healing counsels, that if it be thy
blessed will, we may still enjoy that happy tranquility
which hitherto thou hast continued to us! Amen, Amen!</p>
