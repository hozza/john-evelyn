<p>To London to hear Mr. Stringfellow
preach his first sermon in the newly erected Church of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Trinity, in Conduit Street; to which I did recommend
him to Dr. Tenison for the constant preacher and lecturer.
This Church, formerly built of timber on Hounslow-Heath
by King James for the mass priests, being
begged by Dr. Tenison, rector of St. Martin's, was set
up by that public-minded, charitable, and pious man near
my son's dwelling in Dover Street, chiefly at the charge
of the Doctor. I know him to be an excellent preacher
and a fit person. This Church, though erected in St.
Martin's, which is the Doctor's parish, he was not only
content, but was the sole industrious mover, that it should
be made a separate parish, in regard of the neighborhood
having become so populous. Wherefore to countenance
and introduce the new minister, and take possession
of a gallery designed for my son's family, I went to
London, where,</p>

<p>19th <a id="tn_png_324"></a><!--TN: Comma added after "July"-->July, 1691. In the morning Dr. Tenison preached
the first sermon, taking his text from Psalm xxvi. 8.
"Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the
place where thine honor dwelleth." In concluding, he
gave that this should be made a parish church so soon
as the Parliament sat, and was to be dedicated to the
Holy Trinity, in honor of the three undivided persons in
the Deity; and he minded them to attend to that faith
of the church, now especially that Arianism, Socinianism,
and atheism began to spread among us. In the afternoon,
Mr. Stringfellow preached on Luke vii. 5. "The
centurion who had built a synagogue." He proceeded to
the due praise of persons of such public spirit, and thence
to such a character of pious benefactors in the person
of the generous centurion, as was comprehensive of all
the virtues of an accomplished Christian, in a style so
full, eloquent, and moving, that I never heard a sermon
more apposite to the occasion. He modestly insinuated
the obligation they had to that person who should be
the author and promoter of such public works for the
benefit of mankind, especially to the advantage of religion,
such as building and endowing churches, hospitals, libraries,
schools, procuring the best editions of useful books,
by which he handsomely intimated who it was that had
been so exemplary for his benefaction to that place.
Indeed, that excellent person, Dr. Tenison, had also erected
and furnished a public library [in St. Martin's]; and set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
up two or three free schools at his own charges. Besides
this, he was of an exemplary, holy life, took great pains
in constantly preaching, and incessantly employing himself
to promote the service of God both in public and
private. I never knew a man of a more universal and
generous spirit, with so much modesty, prudence, and
piety.</p>

<p>The great victory of King William's army in Ireland
was looked on as decisive of that war. The French
General, St. Ruth, who had been so cruel to the poor
Protestants in France, was slain, with divers of the best
commanders; nor was it cheap to us, having 1,000 killed,
but of the enemy 4,000 or 5,000.</p>
