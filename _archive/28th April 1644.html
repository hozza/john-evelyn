<p>Taking boat on the Loire, I went
toward Blois, the passage and river being both very
pleasant. Passing Mehun, we dined at Baugenci, and
slept at a little town called St. Dieu. Quitting our bark,
we hired horses to Blois, by the way of Chambord, a
famous house of the King's, built by Francis I. in the
middle of a solitary park, full of deer, inclosed with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
wall. I was particularly desirous of seeing this palace,
from the extravagance of the design, especially the staircase,
mentioned by Palladio. It is said that 1800 workmen
were constantly employed in this fabric for twelve
years: if so, it is wonderful that it was not finished, it
being no greater than divers gentlemen's houses in England,
both for room and circuit. The carvings are indeed
very rich and full. The staircase is devised with four
entries, or assents, which cross one another, so that
though four persons meet, they never come in sight, but
by small loopholes, till they land. It consists of 274
steps (as I remember), and is an extraordinary work,
but of far greater expense than use or beauty. The
chimneys of the house appear like so many towers. About
the whole is a large deep moat. The country about is
full of corn, and wine, with many fair noblemen's houses.</p>

<p>We arrived at Blois in the evening. The town is hilly,
uneven, and rugged, standing on the side of the Loire,
having suburbs joined by a stately stone bridge, on which
is a pyramid with an inscription. At the entrance of
the castle is a stone statue of Louis XII. on horseback,
as large as life, under a Gothic state; and a little below
are these words:</p>
<div class="centerpoem">
<div class="poem">
<span class="ia">"Hic ubi natus erat dextro Ludovicus Olympo,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Sumpsit honoratâ regia sceptra manu;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Felix quæ tanti fulsit Lux nuncia Regis!<br></span>
<span class="i2">Gallica non alio principe digna fuit."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Under this is a very wide pair of gates, nailed full of
wolves and wild-boars' heads. Behind the castle the
present Duke Gaston had begun a fair building, through
which we walked into a large garden, esteemed for its
furniture one of the fairest, especially for simples and
exotic plants, in which he takes extraordinary delight.
On the right hand is a long gallery full of ancient statues
and inscriptions, both of marble and brass; the length,
300 paces, divides the garden into higher and lower
ground, having a very noble fountain. There is the portrait
of a hart, taken in the forest by Louis XII., which
has twenty-four antlers on its <a id="tn_png_095"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period added after "head"-->head. In the Collegiate
Church of St. Savior, we saw many sepulchres of the
Earls of Blois.</p>

<p>On Sunday, being May-day, we walked up into Pall
Mall, very long, and so noble shaded with tall trees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
(being in the midst of a great wood), that unless that of
Tours, I had not seen a statelier.</p>

<p>From hence, we proceeded with a friend of mine through
the adjoining forest, to see if we could meet any wolves,
which are here in such numbers that they often come
and take children out of the very streets; yet will not the
Duke, who is sovereign here, permit them to be destroyed.
We walked five or six miles outright; but met with
none; yet a gentleman, who was resting himself under a
tree, with his horse grazing by him, told us that half an
hour before, two wolves had set upon his horse, and had
in probability devoured him, but for a dog which lay by
him. At a little village at the end of this wood, we ate
excellent cream, and visited a castle builded on a very
steep cliff.</p>

<p>Blois is a town where the language is exactly spoken;
the inhabitants very courteous; the air so good, that it is
the ordinary nursery of the King's children. The people
are so ingenious, that, for goldsmith's work and watches,
no place in France affords the like. The pastures by the
river are very rich and pleasant.</p>
