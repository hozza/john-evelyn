<p>To Dover; but the fleet did not appear
till the 16th, when the Duke of York with his and the
French squadron, in all 170 ships (of which above 100
were men-of-war), sailed by, after the Dutch, who were
newly withdrawn. Such a gallant and formidable navy
never, I think, spread sail upon the seas. It was a goodly
yet terrible sight, to behold them as I did, passing eastward
by the straits between Dover and Calais in a
glorious day. The wind was yet so high, that I could
not well go aboard, and they were soon got out of sight.
The next day, having visited our prisoners and the Castle,
and saluted the Governor, I took horse for Margate.
Here, from the North Foreland Lighthouse top (which is
a pharos, built of brick, and having on the top a cradle
of iron, in which a man attends a great sea-coal fire all
the year long, when the nights are dark, for the safeguard
of sailors), we could see our fleet as they lay at anchor.
The next morning, they weighed, and sailed out of sight
to the N.Â E.</p>
