<p>I went to London with my
family, to winter at Soho, in the great square.</p>

<p>11th January, 1689-90. This night there was a most
extraordinary storm of wind, accompanied with snow
and sharp weather; it did great harm in many places,
blowing down houses, trees, etc., killing many people.
It began about two in the morning, and lasted till five,
being a kind of hurricane, which mariners observe
have begun of late years to come northward. This
winter has been hitherto extremely wet, warm, and windy.</p>
