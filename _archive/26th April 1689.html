<p>I heard the lawyers plead before the
Lords the writ of error in the judgment of Oates, as to
the charge against him of perjury, which after debate
they referred to the answer of Holloway, etc., who were
his judges. I then went with the Bishop of St. Asaph
to the Archbishop at Lambeth, where they entered into
discourse concerning the final destruction of Antichrist,
both concluding that the third trumpet and vial were now
pouring out. My Lord St. Asaph considered the killing
of the two witnesses, to be the utter destruction of the
Cevennes Protestants by the French and Duke of Savoy,
and the other the Waldenses and Pyrenean Christians,
who by all appearance from good history had kept the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
primitive faith from the very Apostles' time till now.
The doubt his Grace suggested was, whether it could be
made evident that the present persecution had made so
great a havoc of those faithful people as of the other,
and whether there were not yet some among them in being
who met together, it being stated from the text, Apoc.
xi., that they should both be slain together. They both
much approved of Mr. Mede's way of interpretation, and
that he only failed in resolving too hastily on the King
of Sweden's <a id="tn_png_308"></a><!--TN: "Guatavus" changed to "Gustavus"-->(Gustavus Adolphus) success in Germany.
They agreed that it would be good to employ some intelligent
French minister to travel as far as the Pyrenees
to understand the present state of the Church there, it
being a country where hardly anyone travels.</p>

<p>There now came certain news that King James had
not only landed in Ireland, but that he had surprised
Londonderry, and was become master of that kingdom, to
the great shame of our government, who had been so
often solicited to provide against it by timely succor, and
which they might so easily have done. This is a terrible
beginning of more troubles, especially should an army
come thence into Scotland, people being generally disaffected
here and everywhere else, so that the seamen and
landmen would scarce serve without compulsion.</p>

<p>A new oath was now fabricating for all the clergy to
take, of obedience to the present Government, in abrogation
of the former oaths of allegiance, which it is foreseen
many of the bishops and others of the clergy will not
take. The penalty is to be the loss of their dignity and
spiritual preferment. This is thought to have been driven
on by the Presbyterians, our new governors. God in
mercy send us help, and direct the counsels to his glory
and good of his Church!</p>

<p>Public matters went very ill in Ireland: confusion and
dissensions among ourselves, stupidity, inconstancy, emulation,
the governors employing unskillful men in greatest
offices, no person of public spirit and ability appearing,—threaten
us with a very sad prospect of what may be
the conclusion, without God's infinite mercy.</p>

<p>A fight by Admiral Herbert with the French, he imprudently
setting on them in a creek as they were landing
men in Ireland, by which we came off with great
slaughter and little honor—so strangely negligent and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
remiss were we in preparing a timely and sufficient fleet.
The Scots Commissioners offer the crown to the <span class="smcap">new
King and Queen</span> on conditions.—Act of Poll-money came
forth, sparing none.—Now appeared the Act of Indulgence
for the Dissenters, but not exempting them from
paying dues to the Church of England clergy, or serving
in office according to law, with several other clauses.—A
most splendid embassy from Holland to congratulate
the King and Queen on their accession to the crown.</p>
