<p>I went with Lord Howard of Norfolk,
to visit Sir William Ducie at Charlton, where we
dined; the servants made our coachmen so drunk, that
they both fell off their boxes on the heath, where we
were fain to leave them, and were driven to London
by two servants of my Lord's. This barbarous custom
of making the masters welcome by intoxicating the
servants, had now the second time happened to my
coachmen.</p>

<p>My son finally came from Oxford.</p>
