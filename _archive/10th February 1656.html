<p>I heard Dr. Wilkins preach before
the Lord Mayor in St. Paul's, showing how obedience
was preferable to sacrifice. He was a most obliging
person, who had married the Protector's sister, and took
great pains to preserve the Universities from the ignorant,
sacrilegious commanders and soldiers, who would fain
have demolished all places and persons that pretended
to learning.</p>
