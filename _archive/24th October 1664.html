<p>We dined at Sir Timothy Tyrill's
at Shotover. This gentleman married the daughter and
heir of Dr. James Usher, Archbishop of Armagh, that
learned prelate. There is here in the grove a fountain
of the coldest water I ever felt, and very clear. His
plantation of oaks and other timber is very commendable.
We went in the evening to Oxford, lay at Dr. Hyde's,
principal of Magdalen-Hall (related to the Lord Chancellor),
brother to the Lord Chief Justice and that Sir
Henry Hyde, who lost his head for his loyalty. We were
handsomely entertained two days. The Vice-Chancellor,
who with Dr. Fell, Dean of Christ Church, the learned
Dr. Barlow, Warden of Queen's, and several heads of
houses, came to visit Lord Cornbury (his father being
now Chancellor of the University), and next day invited
us all to dinner. I went to visit Mr. Boyle (now here),
whom I found with Dr. Wallis and Dr. Christopher Wren,
in the tower of the schools, with an inverted tube, or
telescope, observing the discus of the sun for the passing
of Mercury that day before it; but the latitude was
so great that nothing appeared; so we went to see the
rarities in the library, where the keepers showed me my
name among the benefactors. They have a cabinet of
some medals, and pictures of the muscular parts of man's
body. Thence, to the new theater, now building at an
exceeding and royal expense by the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury [Sheldon], to keep the Acts in for the future,
till now being in St. Mary's Church. The foundation
had been newly laid, and the whole designed by that
incomparable genius my worthy friend, Dr. Christopher
Wren, who showed me the model, not disdaining my
advice in some particulars. Thence, to see the picture
on the wall over the altar of All Souls, being the largest
piece of fresco painting (or rather in imitation of it, for
it is in oil of turpentine) in England, not ill designed by
the hand of one Fuller; yet I fear it will not hold long.
It seems too full of nakeds for a chapel.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>Thence, to New College, and the painting of Magdalen
chapel, which is on blue cloth in <i>chiar oscuro</i>, by one
Greenborow, being a <i>Cœna Domini</i>, and a "Last Judgment"
on the wall by Fuller, as in the other, but somewhat
varied.</p>

<p>Next to Wadham, and the Physic Garden, where were
two large locust trees, and as many platani (plane trees),
and some rare plants under the culture of old Bobart.</p>
