<p>I returned homeward, passing again
through Colchester; and, by the way, near the ancient
town of Chelmsford, saw New Hall, built in a park by
Henry VII. and VIII., and given by Queen Elizabeth to
the Earl of Sussex, who sold it to the late great Duke of
Buckingham, and since seized on by Oliver Cromwell
(pretended Protector). It is a fair old house, built with
brick, low, being only of two stories, as the manner then
was; the gate-house better; the court, large and pretty; the
staircase, of extraordinary wideness, with a piece representing
Sir Francis Drake's action in the year 1580, an
excellent sea-piece; the galleries are trifling; the hall is
noble; the garden a fair plot, and the whole seat well
accommodated with water; but, above all, I admired the
fair avenue planted with stately lime trees, in four rows,
for near a mile in length. It has three descents, which
is the only fault, and may be reformed. There is another
fair walk of the same at the mall and wilderness, with a
tennis-court, and pleasant terrace toward the park, which
was well stored with deer and ponds.</p>
