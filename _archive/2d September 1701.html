<p>I went to Kensington, and saw
the house, plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.
Wise, who was there to receive me.</p>

<p>The death of King James, happening on the 15th of
this month, N. S., after two or three days' indisposition,
put an end to that unhappy Prince's troubles, after a
short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly attempting to
bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the
Jesuits; which the nation would not endure.</p>

<p>Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague
about the Duke of Albemarle's estate, claiming
under a will supposed to have been forged, is said to have
been worth £10,000 to the lawyers. His eldest son shot
himself a few days after his father's death; for what
cause is not clear. He was a most hopeful young man,
and had behaved so bravely against the Turks at the
siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a Count of
the Empire. It was falsely reported that Sir Edward
Seymour was dead, a great man; he had often been
Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and in many other lucrative
offices. He was of a hasty spirit, not at all sincere,
but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.</p>
