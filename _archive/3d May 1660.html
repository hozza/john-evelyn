<p>Came the most happy tidings of his
Majesty's gracious declaration and applications to the
Parliament, General, and people, and their dutiful acceptance
and acknowledgment, after a most bloody and
unreasonable rebellion of near twenty years. Praised be
forever the Lord of Heaven, who only doeth wondrous
things, because his mercy endureth forever.</p>
