<p>This day died Mr. Samuel Pepys, a
very worthy, industrious and curious person, none in
England exceeding him in knowledge of the navy, in
which he had passed through all the most considerable
offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity. When
King James II. went out of England, he laid down his
office, and would serve no more; but withdrawing himself
from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with his
partner, Mr. Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble
house and sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of
his labors in great prosperity. He was universally beloved,
hospitable, generous, learned in many things,
skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men
of whom he had the conversation. His library and collection
of other curiosities were of the most considerable,
the models of ships especially. Besides what he
published of an account of the navy, as he found and
left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History
of the Navy, or <i>Navalia</i>, as he called it; but how
far advanced, and what will follow of his, is left, I suppose,
to his sister's son, Mr. Jackson, a young gentleman,
whom Mr. Pepys had educated in all sorts
of useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from
whence he returned with extraordinary accomplishments,
and worthy to be heir. Mr. Pepys had been for near
forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr. Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one
to hold up the pall at his magnificent obsequies; but my
indisposition hindered me from doing him this last office.</p>
