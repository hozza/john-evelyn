<p>I went with my wife to St.
Germains, to condole with Mr.Â Waller's loss. I carried
with me and treated at dinner that excellent and pious
person the Dean of St. Paul's, Dr. Stewart, and Sir
Lewis Dives (half-brother to the Earl of Bristol), who
entertained us with his wonderful escape out of prison
in Whitehall, the very evening before he was to have
been put to death, leaping down out of a jakes two
stories high into the Thames at high water, in the
coldest of winter, and at night; so as by swimming he
got to a boat that attended for him, though he was
guarded by six musketeers. After this, he went about
in women's habit, and then in a small-coal-man's, traveling
200 miles on foot, embarked for Scotland with
some men he had raised, who coming on shore were
all surprised and imprisoned on the Marquis of Montrose's
score; he not knowing anything of their barbarous
murder of that hero. This he told us was his fifth
escape, and none less miraculous; with this note, that
the charging through 1,000 men armed, or whatever
danger could befall a man, he believed could not more
confound and distract a man's thoughts than the execution
of a premeditated escape, the passions of hope and
fear being so strong. This knight was indeed a valiant
gentleman; but not a little given to romance, when
he spoke of himself. I returned to Paris the same
evening.</p>
