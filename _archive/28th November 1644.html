<p>I went to see the garden and
house of the Aldobrandini, now Cardinal Borghese's.
This palace is, for architecture, magnificence, pomp, and
state, one of the most considerable about the city. It
has four fronts, and a noble piazza before it. Within
the courts, under arches supported by marble columns,
are many excellent statues. Ascending the stairs, there
is a rare figure of Diana, of white marble. The St.
Sebastian and Hermaphrodite are of stupendous art.
For paintings, our Savior's Head, by Correggio; several
pieces of Raphael, some of which are small; some of
Bassano Veronese; the Leda, and two admirable Venuses,
are of Titian's pencil; so is the Psyche and Cupid; the
head of St. John, borne by Herodias; two heads of
Albert Durer, very exquisite. We were shown here a fine
cabinet and tables of Florence work in stone. In the
gardens are many fine fountains, the walls covered with
citron trees, which, being rarely spread, invest the stone
work entirely; and, toward the street, at a back gate,
the port is so handsomely clothed with ivy as much
pleased me. About this palace are many noble antique
bassi-relievi: two especially are placed on the ground,
representing armor, and other military furniture of the
Romans; beside these, stand about the garden numerous
rare statues, altars, and urns. Above all for antiquity
and curiosity (as being the only rarity of that
nature now known to remain) is that piece of old Roman
painting representing the Roman <i>Sponsalia</i>, or celebration
of their marriage, judged to be 1,400 years old, yet are
the colors very lively, and the design very entire, though
found deep in the ground. For this morsel of painting's
sake only, it is said the Borghesi purchased the house,
because this being on a wall in a kind of banqueting
house in the garden, could not be removed, but passes
with the inheritance.</p>
