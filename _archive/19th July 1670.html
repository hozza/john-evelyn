<p>I accompanied my worthy friend, that
excellent man, Sir Robert Murray, with Mr. Slingsby,
master of the mint, to see the latter's seat and estate
at Burrow-Green in Cambridgeshire, he desiring our
advice for placing a new house, which he was resolved
to build. We set out in a coach and six horses with
him and his lady, dined about midway at one Mr.
Turner's, where we found a very noble dinner, venison,
music, and a circle of country ladies and their gallants.
After dinner, we proceeded, and came to Burrow-Green
that night. This had been the ancient seat of the
Cheekes (whose daughter Mr. Slingsby married), formerly
tutor to King Henry VI. The old house large and ample,
and built for ancient hospitality, ready to fall down with
age, placed in a dirty hole, a stiff clay, no water, next
an adjoining church-yard, and with other inconveniences.
We pitched on a spot of rising ground, adorned with
venerable woods, a dry and sweet prospect east and
west, and fit for a park, but no running water; at a mile
distance from the old house.</p>
