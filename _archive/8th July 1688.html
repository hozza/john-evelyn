<p>One of the King's chaplains preached
before the Princess on Exodus xiv. 13, "Stand still, and
behold the salvation of the Lord," which he applied so
boldly to the present conjuncture of the Church of England,
that more could scarce be said to encourage desponders.
The Popish priests were not able to carry their
cause against their learned adversaries, who confounded
them both by their disputes and writings.</p>
