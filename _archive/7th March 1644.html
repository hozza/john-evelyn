<p>I set forward with some company
toward Fontainebleau, a sumptuous Palace of the King's,
like ours at Hampton Court, about fourteen leagues from
the city. By the way, we pass through a forest so prodigiously
encompassed with hideous rocks of whitish hard
stone, heaped one on another in mountainous heights,
that I think the like is nowhere to be found more horrid
and solitary. It abounds with stags, wolves, boars,
and not long after a lynx, or ounce, was killed among
them, which had devoured some passengers. On the
summit of one of these gloomy precipices, intermingled
with trees and shrubs, the stones hanging over, and menacing
ruin, is built an hermitage. In these solitudes,
rogues frequently lurk and do mischief (and for whom
we were all well appointed with our carabines); but we
arrived safe in the evening at the village, where we lay
at the Horne, going early next morning to the Palace.</p>

<p>This House is nothing so stately and uniform as Hampton
Court, but Francis I. began much to beautify it; most
of all Henry IV. (and not a little) the late King. It
abounds with fair halls, chambers, and galleries; in the
longest, which is 360 feet long, and 18 broad, are painted
the Victories of that great Prince, Henry IV. That of
Francis I., called the grand Gallery, has all the King's
palaces painted in it; above these, in sixty pieces of excellent
work in fresco, is the History of Ulysses, from
Homer, by Primaticcio, in the time of Henry III., esteemed
the most renowned in Europe for the design.
The Cabinet is full of excellent pictures, especially a
Woman, of Raphael. In the Hall of the Guards is a
piece of tapestry painted on the wall, very naturally,
representing the victories of Charles VII. over our countrymen.
In the Salle des Festins is a rare Chimney-piece,
and Henry IV. on horseback, of white marble, esteemed
worth 18,000 crowns; Clementia and Pax, nobly done.
On columns of jasper, two lions of brass. The new stairs,
and a half circular court, are of modern and good architecture,
as is a chapel built by Louis XIII., all of jasper,
with several incrustations of marble through the inside.</p>

<p>Having seen the rooms, we went to the volary, which
has a cupola in the middle of it, great trees and bushes,
it being full of birds who drank at two fountains. There
is also a fair tennis court, and noble stables; but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
beauty of all are the gardens. In the Court of the Fountains
stand divers antiquities and statues, especially a
Mercury. In the Queen's Garden is a Diana ejecting a
fountain, with numerous other brass statues.</p>

<p>The great Garden, 180 toises long and 154 wide, has
in the center a fountain of Tyber of a Colossean figure
of brass, with the Wolf over Romulus and Remus. At
each corner of the garden rises a fountain. In the garden
of the piscina, is a Hercules of white marble; next,
is that of the pines, and without that a canal of an
English mile in length, at the end of which rise three
jettos in the form of a fleur-de-lis, of a great height; on
the margin are excellent walks planted with trees. The
carps come familiarly to hand (to be fed). Hence they
brought us to a spring, which they say being first discovered
by a dog, gave occasion of beautifying this
place, both with the palace and gardens. The white
and terrific rocks at some distance in the forest, yield
one of the most august and stupendous prospects imaginable.
The park about this place is very large, and the
town full of noblemen's houses.</p>

<p>Next morning, we were invited by a painter, who was
keeper of the pictures and rarities, to see his own collection.
We were led through a gallery of old Rosso's
work, at the end of which, in another cabinet, were three
Madonnas of Raphael, and two of Andrea del Sarto. In
the Academy where the painter himself wrought, was a
St. Michael of Raphael, very rare; St. John Baptist of
Leonardo, and a Woman's head; a Queen of Sicily, and
St. Margaret of Raphael; two more Madonnas, whereof
one very large, by the same hand; some more of del
Sarto; a St. Jerome, of Perino del Vaga; the Rape of
Proserpine, very <a id="tn_png_084"></a><!--TN: Colon changed to semicolon after "good"-->good; and a great number of drawings.</p>

<p>Returning part of our way to Paris, that day, we
visited a house called <i>Maison Rouge</i>, having an excellent
prospect, grot, and fountains, one whereof rises fifty feet,
and resembles the noise of a tempest, battle of guns, etc.,
at its issue.</p>

<p>Thence to Essone, a house of Monsieur Essling, who
is a great virtuoso; there are many good paintings in it;
but nothing so observable as his gardens, fountains, fish-pools,
especially that in a triangular form, the water cast
out by a multitude of heads about it; there is a noble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
cascade and pretty baths, with all accommodations. Under
a marble table is a fountain of serpents twisting about a
globe.</p>

<p>We alighted next at Corbeil, a town famous for the
siege by Henry IV. Here we slept, and returned next
morning to Paris.</p>
