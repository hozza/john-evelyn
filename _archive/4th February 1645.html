<p>We were invited to the collection
of exotic rarities in the Museum of Ferdinando Imperati,
a Neapolitan nobleman, and one of the most observable
palaces in the city, the repository of incomparable
rarities. Among the natural herbals most remarkable
was the Byssus marina and Pinna marina; the male and
female chameleon; an Onocrotatus; an extraordinary great
crocodile; some of the Orcades Anates, held here for a
great rarity; likewise a salamander; the male and female
Manucordiata, the male having a hollow in the back, in
which it is reported the female both lays and hatches
her eggs; the mandragoras, of both sexes; Papyrus,
made of several reeds, and some of silk; tables of
the rinds of trees, written with Japonic characters;
another of the branches of palm; many Indian fruits;
a crystal that had a quantity of uncongealed water
within its cavity; a petrified fisher's net; divers sorts of
tarantulas, being a monstrous spider, with lark-like claws,
and somewhat bigger.</p>
