<p>I changed my lodging in the Place
de Monsieur de Metz, near the Abbey of St. Germains;
and thence, on the 12th of February, to another in Rue
Columbier, where I had a very fair apartment, which
cost me four pistoles per month. The 18th, I frequented
a course of Chemistry, the famous Monsieur Le Febure
operating upon most of the nobler processes. March 3d,
Monsieur Mercure began to teach me on the lute, though
to small perfection.</p>

<p>In May, I fell sick, and had very weak eyes; for which
I was four times let bleed.</p>
