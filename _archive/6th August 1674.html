<p>I went to Groombridge, to see my
old friend, Mr. Packer; the house built within a moat,
in a woody valley. The old house had been the place of
confinement of the Duke of Orleans, taken by one Waller
(whose house it then was) at the battle of Agincourt,
now demolished, and a new one built in its place, though
a far better situation had been on the south of the wood,
on a graceful ascent. At some small distance, is a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
chapel, not long since built by Mr. Packer's father, on a
vow he made to do it on the return of King Charles I.
out of Spain, 1625, and dedicated to St. Charles, but
what saint there was then of that name I am to seek,
for, being a Protestant, I conceive it was not Borromeo.</p>

<p>I went to see my farm at Ripe, near Lewes.</p>
