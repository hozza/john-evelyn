<p>The King enjoining the ministers to
read his Declaration for giving liberty of conscience (as
it was styled) in all churches of England, this evening,
six Bishops, Bath and Wells,<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_65_65">65</a> Peterborough,<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_66_66">66</a> Ely,<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_67_67">67</a> Chichester,<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_68_68">68</a>
St. Asaph,<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_69_69">69</a> and Bristol,<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_70_70">70</a> in the name of all
the rest of the Bishops, came to his Majesty to petition
him, that he would not impose the reading of it to the
several congregations within their dioceses; not that they
were averse to the publishing it for want of due tenderness
toward dissenters, in relation to whom they should
be willing to come to such a temper as should be thought
fit, when that matter might be considered and settled in
Parliament and Convocation; but that, the Declaration
being founded on such a dispensing power as might at
pleasure set aside all laws ecclesiastical and civil, it appeared
to them illegal, as it had done to the Parliament
in 1661 and 1672, and that it was a point of such consequence,
that they could not so far make themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
parties to it, as the reading of it in church in time of
divine service amounted to.</p>

<p>The King was so far incensed at this address, that he
with threatening expressions commanded them to obey
him in reading it at their perils, and so dismissed them.</p>
