<p>I went toward Bois-le-Duc,
where we arrived on the 16th, at the time when the new
citadel was advancing, with innumerable hands, and
incomparable inventions for draining off the waters out
of the fens and morasses about it, being by buckets,
mills, cochleas, pumps, and the like; in which the Hollanders
are the most expert in Europe. Here were now
sixteen companies and nine troops of horse. They were
also cutting a new river, to pass from the town to a
castle not far from it. Here we split our skiff, falling
foul upon another through negligence of the master, who
was fain to run aground, to our no little hazard. At our
arrival, a soldier conveyed us to the Governor, where our
names were taken, and our persons examined very
strictly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
