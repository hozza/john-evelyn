<p>I went to Deptford, where I made
preparation for my settlement, no more intending to go
out of England, but endeavor a settled life, either in
this or some other place, there being now so little
appearance of any change for the better, all being entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
in the rebels' hands; and this particular habitation and
the estate contiguous to it (belonging to my father-in-law,
actually in his Majesty's service) very much suffering
for want of some friend to rescue it out of the power
of the usurpers, so as to preserve our interest, and take
some care of my other concerns, by the advice and
endeavor of my friends I was advised to reside in it,
and compound with the soldiers. This I was besides
authorized by his Majesty to do, and encouraged with
a promise that what was in lease from the Crown, if
ever it pleased God to restore him, he would secure
to us in fee farm. I had also addresses and cyphers, to
correspond with his Majesty and Ministers abroad: upon
all which inducements, I was persuaded to settle henceforth
in England, having now run about the world, most
part out of my own country, near ten years. I therefore
now likewise meditated sending over for my wife, whom
as yet I had left at Paris.</p>
