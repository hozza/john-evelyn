<p>To the old and ragged city of
Leicester, large and pleasantly seated, but despicably
built, the chimney flues like so many smiths' forges;
however, famous for the tomb of the tyrant, Richard III.,
which is now converted to a cistern, at which (I think)
cattle drink. Also, here in one of the churches lies
buried the magnificent Cardinal Wolsey. John of Gaunt
has here also built a large but poor hospital, near which
a wretch has made him a house out of the ruins of a
stately church. Saw the ruins of an old Roman Temple,
thought to be of Janus. Entertained at a very fine collection
of fruits, such as I did not expect to meet with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
so far North, especially very good melons. We returned
to my uncle's.</p>
