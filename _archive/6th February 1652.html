<p>I embarked early in the packet
boat, but put my goods in a stouter vessel. It was calm,
so that we got not to Dover till eight at night. I took
horse for Canterbury, and lay at Rochester; next day, to
Gravesend, took a pair of oars, and landed at Sayes Court,
where I stayed three days to refresh, and look after my
packet and goods, sent by a stouter vessel. I went to
visit my cousin, Richard Fanshawe, and divers other
friends.</p>
