<p>I accompanied my Lady Clarendon
to her house at Swallowfield, in Berks, dining by the
way at Mr. Graham's lodge at Bagshot; the house, newly
repaired and capacious enough for a good family, stands
in a park.</p>

<p>Hence, we went to Swallowfield; this house is after the
ancient building of honorable gentlemen's houses, when
they kept up ancient hospitality, but the gardens and
waters as elegant as it is possible to make a flat by
art and industry, and no mean expense, my lady being
so extraordinarily skilled in the flowery part, and my lord
in diligence of planting; so that I have hardly seen a
seat which shows more tokens of it than what is to be
found here, not only in the delicious and rarest fruits of
a garden, but in those innumerable timber trees in the
ground about the seat, to the greatest ornament and benefit
of the place. There is one orchard of 1,000 golden,
and other cider pippins; walks and groves of elms, limes,
oaks, and other trees. The garden is so beset with all
manner of sweet shrubs, that it perfumes the air. The
distribution also of the quarters, walks, and parterres, is
excellent. The nurseries, kitchen-garden full of the most
desirable plants; two very noble orangeries well furnished:
but, above all, the canal and fish ponds, the one fed with
a white, the other with a black running water, fed by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
quick and swift river, so well and plentifully stored with
fish, that for pike, carp, bream, and tench, I never saw
anything approaching it. We had at every meal carp
and pike of a size fit for the table of a Prince, and what
added to the delight was, to see the hundreds taken by
the drag, out of which, the cook standing by, we pointed
out what we had most mind to, and had carp that would
have been worth at London twenty shillings a piece.
The waters are flagged about with <i>Cal√°mus aromaticus</i>,
with which my lady has hung a closet, that retains the
smell very perfectly. There is also a certain sweet willow
and other exotics: also a very fine bowling-green,
meadow, pasture, and wood; in a word, all that can
render a country seat delightful. There is besides a well-furnished
library in the house.</p>
