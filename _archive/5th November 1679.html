<p>I was invited to dine at my
Lord Teviotdale's, a Scotch Earl, a learned and knowing
nobleman. We afterward went to see Mr. Montague's

Hooke, somewhat after the French; it was most nobly
furnished, and a fine, but too much exposed garden.<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_42_42">42</a></p>
