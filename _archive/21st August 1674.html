<p>In one of the meadows at the foot
of the long Terrace below the Castle [Windsor], works
were thrown up to show the King a representation of the
city of Maestricht, newly taken by the French. Bastians,
bulwarks, ramparts, palisadoes, graffs, horn-works,
counter-scarps, etc., were constructed. It was attacked
by the Duke of Monmouth (newly come from the real
siege) and the Duke of York, with a little army, to
show their skill in tactics. On Saturday night they
made their approaches, opened trenches, raised batteries,
took the counter-scarp and ravelin, after a stout
defense; great guns fired on both sides, grenadoes shot,
mines sprung, parties sent out, attempts of rais<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>ing
the siege, prisoners taken, parleys; and, in short, all
the circumstances of a formal siege, to appearance, and,
what is most strange all without disorder, or ill accident,
to the great satisfaction of a thousand spectators.
Being night, it made a formidable show. The siege being
over, I went with Mr. Pepys back to London, where we
arrived about three in the morning.</p>
