<p>I went to see the Count de Liancourt's
Palace in the Rue de Seine, which is well built. Toward
his study and bedchamber joins a little garden, which,
though very narrow, by the addition of a well-painted
perspective, is to appearance greatly enlarged; to this
there is another part, supported by arches in which runs
a stream of water, rising in the aviary, out of a statue,
and seeming to flow for some miles, by being artificially
continued in the painting, when it sinks down at the wall.
It is a very agreeable deceit. At the end of this garden
is a little theater, made to change with divers pretty
scenes, and the stage so ordered, with figures of men and
women painted on light boards, and cut out, and, by a
person who stands underneath, made to act as if they
were speaking, by guiding them, and reciting words in
different tones, as the parts require. We were led into a
round cabinet, where was a neat invention for reflecting
lights, by lining divers sconces with thin shining plates
of gilded copper.</p>

<p>In one of the rooms of state was an excellent painting
of Poussin, being a Satyr kneeling; over the chimney,
the Coronation of the Virgin, by Paulo Veronese; another
Madonna over the door, and that of Joseph, by Cigali;
in the Hall, a Cavaliero di Malta, attended by his page,
said to be of Michael Angelo; the Rape of Proserpine,
with a very large landscape of Correggio. In the next
room are some paintings of Primaticcio, especially the
Helena, the naked Lady brought before Alexander,
well painted, and a Ceres. In the bedchamber a picture
of the Cardinal de Liancourt, of Raphael, rarely colored.
In the cabinet are divers pieces of Bassano, two of
Polemburg, four of Paulo Brill, the skies a little too
blue. A Madonna of Nicholao, excellently painted on a
stone; a Judith of Mantegna; three women of Jeronimo;
one of Stenwick; a Madonna after Titian, and a Magdalen
of the same hand, as the Count esteems it: two small
pieces of Paulo Veronese, being the Martyrdoms of St. Justina
and St. Catherine; a Madonna of Lucas Van Leyden,
sent him from our King; six more of old Bassano; two excellent
drawings of Albert; a Magdalen of Leonardo da
Vinci; four of Paulo; a very rare Madonna of Titian, given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
him also by our King; the <i>Ecce Homo</i>, shut up in a
frame of velvet, for the life and accurate finishing exceeding
all description. Some curious agates, and a chaplet
of admirable invention, the intaglios being all on fruit
stones. The Count was so exceeding civil, that he would
needs make his lady go out of her dressing room, that he
might show us the curiosities and pictures in it.</p>

<p>We went thence to visit one Monsieur Perishot, one of
the greatest virtuosos in France, for his collection of
pictures, agates, medals, and flowers, especially tulips
and anemonies. The chiefest of his paintings was a
Sebastian, of Titian.</p>

<p>From him we went to Monsieur Frene's, who showed
us many rare drawings, a Rape of Helen in black chalk;
many excellent things of Sneiders, all naked; some of
Julio and Michael Angelo; a Madonna of Passignano;
some things of Parmensis, and other masters.</p>

<p>The next morning, being recommended to one Monsieur
de Hausse, President of the Parliament, and once Ambassador
at Venice for the French King, we were very civilly
received, and showed his library. Among his paintings
were a rare Venus and Adonis of Veronese, a St. Anthony,
after the first manner of Correggio, and a rare
Madonna of Palma.</p>

<p>Sunday, the 6th of March, I went to Charenton, two
leagues from Paris, to hear and see the manner of the
French Protestant Church service. The place of meeting
they call the Temple, a very fair and spacious room,
built of freestone, very decently adorned with paintings
of the Tables of the Law, the Lord's Prayer, and Creed.
The pulpit stands at the upper end in the middle, having
an inclosure of seats about it, where the Elders and
persons of greatest quality and strangers, sit; the rest of
the congregation on forms and low stools, but none in
pews, as in our churches, to their great disgrace, as
nothing so orderly, as here the stools and other cumber
are removed when the assembly rises. I was greatly
pleased with their harmonious singing the Psalms, which
they all learn perfectly well, their children being as duly
taught these, as their catechism.</p>

<p>In our passage, we went by that famous bridge over the
Marne, where that renowned echo returns the voice of a
good singer nine or ten times.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
