<p>Dined at my Lord Treasurer's,
the Earl of Southampton, in Bloomsbury, where he was
building a noble square or piazza,<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_1">1</a> a little town; his own
house stands too low, some noble rooms, a pretty cedar
chapel, a naked garden to the north, but good air. I had
much discourse with his Lordship, whom I found to be a
person of extraordinary parts, but a <i>valetudinarian</i>.â€”I
went to St. James's Park, where I saw various animals,
and examined the throat of the <i>Onocrotylus</i>, or pelican, a
fowl between a stork and a swan; a melancholy water-fowl,
brought from Astrakhan by the Russian Ambassador;
it was diverting to see how he would toss up and turn
a flat fish, plaice, or flounder, to get it right into his
gullet at its lower beak, which, being filmy, stretches to a
prodigious wideness when it devours a great fish. Here
was also a small water-fowl, not bigger than a moorhen,
that went almost quite erect, like the penguin of America;
it would eat as much fish as its whole body weighed; I
never saw so unsatiable a devourer, yet the body did not
appear to swell the bigger. The solan geese here are
also great devourers, and are said soon to exhaust all the
fish in a pond. Here was a curious sort of poultry not
much exceeding the size of a tame pigeon, with legs so
short as their crops seemed to touch the earth; a milk-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>white
raven; a stork, which was a rarity at this season,
seeing he was loose, and could fly loftily; two Balearian
cranes, one of which having had one of his legs broken
and cut off above the knee, had a wooden or boxen leg
and thigh, with a joint so accurately made that the
creature could walk and use it as well as if it had been
natural; it was made by a soldier. The park was at this
time stored with numerous flocks of several sorts of ordinary
and extraordinary wild fowl, breeding about the
Decoy, which for being near so great a city, and among
such a concourse of soldiers and people, is a singular and
diverting thing. There were also deer of several countries,
white; spotted like leopards; antelopes, an elk, red
deer, roebucks, stags, Guinea goats, Arabian sheep, etc.
There were withy-pots, or nests, for the wild fowl to lay
their eggs in, a little above the surface of the water.</p>
