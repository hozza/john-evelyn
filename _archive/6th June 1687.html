<p>I visited my Lady Pierpoint, daughter
to Sir John Evelyn, of Deane [in Wilts], now widow of
Mr. Pierpoint, and mother of the Earl of Kingston. She
was now engaged in the marriage of my cousin, Evelyn
Pierpoint, her second son.</p>

<p>There was about this time brought into the Downs a
vast treasure, which was sunk in a Spanish galleon about
forty-five years ago, somewhere near Hispaniola, or the
Bahama islands, and was now weighed up by some gentlemen,
who were at the charge of divers, etc., to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
enriching them beyond all expectation. The Duke of
Albemarle's share [Governor of Jamaica] came to, I believe,
£50,000. Some private gentlemen who adventured
£100, gained from £8,000 to £10,000. His Majesty's
tenth was £10,000.</p>

<p>The Camp was now again pitched at Hounslow, the
Commanders profusely vying in the expense and magnificence
of tents.</p>
