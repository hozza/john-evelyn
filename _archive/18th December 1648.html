<p>I got privately into the council
of the rebel army, at Whitehall, where I heard horrid
villanies.</p>

<p>This was a most exceedingly wet year, neither frost nor
snow all the winter for more than six days in all. Cattle
died every where of a murrain.</p>

<p>1st January, 1648-49. I had a lodging and some books
at my father-in-law's house, Sayes Court.</p>
