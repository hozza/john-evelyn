<p>To London, to visit some friends,
but the insolences were so great in the streets that I
could not return till the next day.</p>

<p>Dr. Scarborough was instant with me to give the Tables
of Veins and Arteries to the College of Physicians, pretending
he would not only read upon them, but celebrate
my curiosity as being the first who caused them to be
completed in that manner, and with that cost; but I was
not so willing yet to part with them, as to lend them to
the College during their anatomical lectures; which I did
accordingly.</p>
