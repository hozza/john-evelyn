<p>This evening I accompanied Mr.
Treasurer and Vice-Chamberlain Carteret to his lately
married son-in-law's, Sir Thomas Scott, to Scott's Hall.
We took barge as far as Gravesend, and thence by post
to Rochester, whence in coach and six horses to Scott's
Hall; a right noble seat, uniformly built, with a handsome
gallery. It stands in a park well stored, the land fat
and good. We were exceedingly feasted by the young
knight, and in his pretty chapel heard an excellent sermon
by his chaplain. In the afternoon, preached the
learned Sir Norton Knatchbull (who has a noble seat
hard by, and a plantation of stately fir trees). In the
churchyard of the parish church I measured an overgrown
yew tree, that was eighteen of my paces in compass,
out of some branches of which, torn off by the
winds, were sawed divers goodly planks.</p>
