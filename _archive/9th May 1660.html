<p>I was desired and designed to accompany
my Lord Berkeley with the public address of the Parliament,
General, etc., to the King, and invite him to come over and
assume his Kingly Government, he being now at Breda;
but I was yet so weak, I could not make that journey by
sea, which was not a little to my detriment, so I went to
London to excuse myself, returning the 10th, having yet
received a gracious message from his Majesty by Major
Scot and Colonel Tuke.</p>
