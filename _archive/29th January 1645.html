<p>We descried Mount Cæcubus, famous
for the generous wine it heretofore produced, and
so rode onward the Appian Way, beset with myrtles, lentiscuses,
bays, pomegranates, and whole groves of orange
trees, and most delicious shrubs, till we came to Formiana
[Formiæ], where they showed us Cicero's tomb,
standing in an olive grove, now a rude heap of stones
without form or beauty; for here that incomparable ora<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>tor
was murdered. I shall never forget how exceedingly
I was delighted with the sweetness of this passage, the
sepulchre mixed among all sorts of verdure; besides
being now come within sight of the noble city, Cajeta
[Gaieta], which gives a surprising prospect along the
Tyrrhene Sea, in manner of a theater: and here we beheld
that strangely cleft rock, a frightful spectacle, which
they say happened upon the passion of our Blessed Savior;
but the haste of our procaccio did not suffer us to
dwell so long on these objects and the many antiquities
of this town as we desired.</p>

<p>At Formi, we saw Cicero's grot; dining at Mola, and
passing Sinuessa, Garigliano (once the city Mintern), and
beheld the ruins of that vast amphitheater and aqueduct
yet standing; the river Liris, which bounded the old Latium,
Falernus, or Mons Massacus, celebrated for its wine,
now named Garo; and this night we lodged at a little
village called St. Agatha, in the Falernian Fields, near
to Aurunca and Sessa.</p>

<p>The next day, having passed [the river] Vulturnus, we
come by the Torre di Francolisi, where Hannibal, in
danger from Fabius Maximus, escaped by debauching
his enemies; and so at last we entered the most pleasant
plains of Campania, now called Terra di Lavoro; in very
truth, I think, the most fertile spot that ever the sun
shone upon. Here we saw the slender ruins of the
once mighty Capua, contending at once both with Rome
and Carthage, for splendor and empire, now nothing but
a heap of rubbish, except showing some vestige of its
former magnificence in pieces of temples, arches, theatres,
columns, ports, vaults, colosses, etc., confounded together
by the barbarous Goths and Longobards; there is,
however, a new city, nearer to the road by two miles,
fairly raised out of these heaps. The passage from this
town to Naples (which is about ten or twelve English
post miles) is as straight as a line, of great breadth,
fuller of travelers than I remember any of our greatest
and most frequented roads near London; but, what is
extremely pleasing, is the great fertility of the fields,
planted with fruit trees, whose boles are serpented with
excellent vines, and they so exuberant, that it is commonly
reported one vine will load five mules with its
grapes. What adds much to the pleasure of the sight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
is, that the vines, climbing to the summit of the trees,
reach in festoons and fruitages from one tree to another,
planted at exact distances, forming a more delightful
picture than painting can describe. Here grow rice,
canes for sugar, olives, pomegranates, mulberries, citrons,
oranges, figs, and other sorts of rare fruits. About the
middle of the way is the town Aversa, whither came
three or four coaches to meet our lady travelers, of whom
we now took leave, having been very merry by the way
with them and the capitáno, their gallant.</p>
