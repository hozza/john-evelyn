<p>Dr. Burnet preached to-day before
the Lord Mayor and a very great congregation, on Proverbs
xxvii. 5, 6, "Open rebuke is better than secret love;
the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of an
enemy." He made a very pathetic discourse concerning
the necessity and advantage of friendly correction.</p>

<p>April, 1700. The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in
obtaining a divorce from his wife by the Parliament for
adultery with Sir John Germaine, a Dutch gamester, of
mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the
Duke had leave to marry again, so that if he should have
children, the Dukedom will go from the late Lord
Thomas's children, Papists indeed, but very hopeful and
virtuous gentlemen, as was their father. The now Duke
their uncle is a Protestant.</p>

<p>The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into
Ireland as commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates
there, toward payment of the debts incurred by the
late war, but which the King had in great measure given
to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably. That this might
be done without suspicion of interest in the Parliament,
it was ordered that no member of either House should
be in the commission. The great contest between the
Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of
amendments and rejecting bills tacked to the money bill,
carried for the Commons. However, this tacking of bills
is a novel practice, suffered by King Charles II., who,
being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.
This was carried but by one voice in the
Lords, all the Bishops following the Court, save one; so
that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph of the
Commons and Country party, but high regret of the
Court, and those to whom the King had given large estates
in Ireland. Pity it is, that things should be brought
to this extremity, the government of this nation being
so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection
on this side heaven, methinks both might be contented
without straining things too far. Among the rest, there
passed a law as to Papists' estates, that if one turned
not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
pass to his next Protestant heir. This indeed seemed a
hard law, but not only the usage of the French King to
his Protestant subjects, but the indiscreet insolence of
the Papists here, going in triumphant and public processions
with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in
divers places (as is said) in the northern counties, has
brought it on their party.</p>
