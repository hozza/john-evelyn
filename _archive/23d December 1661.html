<p>I heard an Italian play and sing
to the guitar with extraordinary skill before the Duke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LONDON</div>

<p>1st January, 1661-62. I went to London, invited to the
solemn foolery of the Prince de la Grange, at Lincoln's-Inn,
where came the King, Duke, etc. It began with a
grand masque, and a formal pleading before the mock
Princes, Grandees, Nobles, and Knights of the Sun. He
had his Lord Chancellor, Chamberlain, Treasurer, and
other Royal Officers, gloriously clad and attended. It
ended in a magnificent banquet. One Mr.Â Lort was the
young spark who maintained the pageantry.</p>
