<p>My birthday, being the 34th
year of my age: blessing God for his providence, I went
to London to visit my brother.</p>

<p>3d <a id="tn_png_337"></a><!--TN: Comma added after "December"-->December, 1654. Advent Sunday. There being no
Office at the church but extemporary prayers after the
Presbyterian way, for now all forms were prohibited, and
most of the preachers were usurpers, I seldom went to
church upon solemn feasts; but, either went to London,
where some of the orthodox sequestered divines did
privately use the Common Prayer, administer sacraments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
etc., or else I procured one to officiate in my house;
wherefore, on the 10th, Dr. Richard Owen, the sequestered
minister of Eltham, preached to my family in my
library, and gave us the Holy Communion.</p>
