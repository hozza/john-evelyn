<p>Upon Sir Robert Reading's importunity,
I went to visit the Duke of Norfolk, at his new
palace at Weybridge, where he has laid out in building
near Â£10,000, on a copyhold, and in a miserable, barren,
sandy place by the street side; never in my life had
I seen such expense to so small purpose. The rooms are
wainscotted, and some of them richly pargeted with cedar,
yew, cypress, etc. There are some good pictures,
especially that incomparable painting of Holbein's, where
the Duke of Norfolk, Charles Brandon and Henry VIII.,
are dancing with the three ladies, with most amorous
countenances, and sprightly motion exquisitely expressed.
It is a thousand pities (as I told my Lord of Arundel,
his son), that that jewel should be given away.</p>
