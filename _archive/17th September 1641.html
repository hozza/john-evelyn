<p>I was permitted to walk the round
and view the works, and to visit a convent of religious
women of the order of St. Clara (who by the capitulation
were allowed to enjoy their monastery and maintenance
undisturbed, at the surrender of the town twelve years
since), where we had a collation and very civil entertainment.
They had a neat chapel, in which the heart of
the Duke of Cleves, their founder, lies inhumed under a
plate of brass. Within the cloister is a garden, and in the
middle of it an overgrown lime tree, out of whose stem,
near the root, issue five upright and exceeding tall suckers,
or bolls, the like whereof for evenness and height I
had not observed.</p>

<p>The chief church of this city is curiously carved within
and without, furnished with a pair of organs, and a most
magnificent font of copper.</p>
