<p>At Lord Berkeley's, I discoursed
with Sir Thomas Modiford, late Governor of Jamaica, and
with Colonel Morgan, who undertook that gallant exploit
from Nombre de Dios to Panama, on the Continent of
America; he told me 10,000 men would easily conquer all
the Spanish Indies, they were so secure. They took great
booty, and much greater had been taken, had they not
been betrayed and so discovered before their approach, by
which the Spaniards had time to carry their vast treasure
on board ships that put off to sea in sight of our men,
who had no boats to follow. They set fire to Panama, and
ravaged the country sixty miles about. The Spaniards
were so supine and unexercised, that they were afraid to
fire a great gun.</p>
