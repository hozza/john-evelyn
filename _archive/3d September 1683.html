<p>I went to see what had been
done by the Duke of Beaufort on his lately purchased
house at Chelsea, which I once had the selling of for the
Countess of Bristol, he had made great alterations, but
might have built a better house with the materials and
the cost he had been at.</p>

<p>Saw the Countess of Monte Feltre, whose husband I had
formerly known, he was a subject of the Pope's, but becoming
a Protestant he resided in England, and married<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
into the family of the Savilles, of Yorkshire. The Count,
her late husband, was a very learned gentleman, a great
politician, and a goodly man. She was accompanied by
her sister, exceedingly skilled in painting, nor did they
spare for color on their own faces. They had a great
deal of wit.</p>
