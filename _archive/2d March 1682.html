<p><span class="smcap">Ash Wednesday.</span> I went to church:
our vicar preached on Proverbs, showing what care and
vigilance was required for the keeping of the heart upright.
The Holy Communion followed, on which I gave
God thanks for his gracious dealing with me in my
late sickness, and affording me this blessed opportunity
of praising him in the congregation, and receiving the
cup of salvation with new and serious resolutions.</p>

<p>Came to see and congratulate my recovery, Sir John
Lowther, Mr. Herbert, Mr. Pepys, Sir Anthony Deane,
and Mr. Hill.</p>
