<p>I made my will, and, taking leave
of my wife and other friends, took horse for England,
paying the messenger eight pistoles for me and my servant
to Calais, setting out with seventeen in company
well-armed, some Portuguese, Swiss, and French, whereof
six were captains and officers. We came the first night
to Beaumont; next day, to Beauvais, and lay at Pois,
and the next, without dining, reached Abbeville; next,
dined at Montreuil, and proceeding met a company on
foot (being now within the inroads of the parties which
dangerously infest this day's journey from St. Omers
and the frontiers), which we drew very near to, ready
and resolute to charge through, and accordingly were
ordered and led by a captain of our train; but, as we
were on the speed, they called out, and proved to be
Scotchmen, newly raised and landed, and few among
them armed. This night, we were well treated at
Boulogne. The next day, we marched in good order, the
passage being now exceeding dangerous, and got to Calais
by a little after two. The sun so scorched my face,
that it made the skin peel off.</p>

<p>I dined with Mr.Â Booth, his Majesty's agent; and,
about three in the afternoon, embarked in the packet-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>boat;
hearing there was a pirate then also setting sail,
we had security from molestation, and so with a fair S.
W. wind in seven hours we landed at Dover. The busy
watchman would have us to the mayor to be searched,
but the gentleman being in bed, we were dismissed.</p>

<p>Next day, being Sunday, they would not permit us to
ride post, so that afternoon our trunks were visited.</p>

<p>The next morning, by four, we set out for Canterbury,
where I met with my Lady Catherine Scott, whom that
very day twelve months before I met at sea going for
France; she had been visiting Sir Thomas Peyton, not
far off, and would needs carry me in her coach to
Gravesend. We dined at Sittingbourne, came late to
Gravesend, and so to Deptford, taking leave of my lady
about four the next morning.</p>
