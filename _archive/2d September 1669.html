<p>I was this day very ill of a pain
in my limbs, which continued most of this week, and
was increased by a visit I made to my old acquaintance,
the Earl of Norwich, at his house in Epping Forest,
where are many good pictures put into the wainscot of
the rooms, which Mr. Baker, his Lordship's predecessor
there, brought out of Spain; especially the History of
Joseph, a picture of the pious and learned Picus Mirandula,
and an incomparable one of old Breugel. The gardens
were well understood, I mean the <i>potager</i>. I returned
late in the evening, ferrying over the water at Greenwich.</p>
