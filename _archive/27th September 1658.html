<p>To Beddington, that ancient seat
of the Carews, a fine old hall, but a scambling house,
famous for the first orange garden in England, being now
overgrown trees, planted in the ground, and secured in
winter with a wooden tabernacle and stoves. This seat
is rarely watered, lying low, and environed with good
pastures. The pomegranates bear here. To the house is
also added a fine park. Thence, to Carshalton, excellently
watered, and capable of being made a most delicious
seat, being on the sweet downs, and a champaign about it
full planted with walnut and cherry trees, which afford a
considerable rent.</p>

<p>Riding over these downs, and discoursing with the
shepherds, I found that digging about the bottom near
Sir Christopher Buckle's,<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_59_59">59</a> near Banstead, divers medals
have been found, both copper and silver, with foundations
of houses, urns, etc. Here, indeed, anciently stood
a city of the Romans. See Antonine's "Itineraries."</p>
