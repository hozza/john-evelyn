<p>I went, as was my usual custom,
and spent an afternoon in Piazza Navona, as well as to
see what antiquities I could purchase among the people
who hold market there for medals, pictures, and such
curiosities, as to hear the mountebanks prate and distribute
their medicines. This was formerly the Circus,
or Agonales, dedicated to sports and pastimes, and is
now the greatest market of the city, having three most
noble fountains, and the stately palaces of the Pamfilii,
St. Giacomo de Spagnoli belonging to that nation, to
which add two convents for friars and nuns, all Spanish.
In this Church was erected a most stately catafalco,
or capellar ardente, for the death of the Queen of Spain;
the church was hung with black, and here I heard a Spanish
sermon, or funeral oration, and observed the statues,
devices, and impresses hung about the walls, the church
and pyramid stuck with thousands of lights and tapers,
which made a glorious show. The statue of St. James
is by Sansovino; there are also some good pictures of
Caracci. The <i>facci√°ta</i>, too, is fair. Returning home, I
passed by the stumps of old Pasquin, at the corner of a
street, called Strada Pontificia; here they still paste up
their drolling lampoons and scurrilous papers. This had
formerly been one of the best statues for workmanship
and art in all the city, as the remaining bust does still show.</p>
