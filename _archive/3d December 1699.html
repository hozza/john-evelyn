<p>Calm, bright, and warm as in the
middle of April. So continued on 21st of January. A

<p>The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of
the Irish forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart
for discharging the vast national debt. They called some
great persons in the highest offices in question for setting
the Great Seal to the pardon of an arch-pirate,<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_89_89">89</a> who had
turned pirate again, and brought prizes into the West
Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey;
but the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers,
out-voted the complaints, not by being more in number,
but by the country party being negligent in attendance.</p>

<p>14th January, 1699-1700. Dr. Lancaster, Vicar of St.
Martin's, dismissed Mr. Stringfellow, who had been made
the first preacher at our chapel by the Bishop of Lincoln
[Dr. Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St. Martin's
by dispensation, and put in one Mr. Sandys, much against
the inclination of those who frequented the chapel. The
Scotch book about Darien was burned by the hangman by
vote of Parliament.<a id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_90_90">90</a></p>
