<p>Reports of an invasion were very
hot, and alarmed the city, Court, and people; nothing
but securing suspected persons, sending forces to the
seaside, and hastening out the fleet. Continued discourse
of the French invasion, and of ours in France.
The eastern wind so constantly blowing, gave our fleet
time to unite, which had been so tardy in preparation,
that, had not God thus wonderfully favored, the enemy
would in all probability have fallen upon us. Many
daily secured, and proclamations out for more conspirators.</p>
