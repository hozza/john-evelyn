<p>This day I first acquainted his
Majesty with that incomparable young man, Gibbon,<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22_22">22</a>
whom I had lately met with in an obscure place by
mere accident, as I was walking near a poor solitary
thatched house, in a field in our parish, near Sayes
Court. I found him shut in; but looking in at the win<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>dow,
I perceived him carving that large cartoon, or
crucifix, of Tintoretto, a copy of which I had myself
brought from Venice, where the original painting remains.
I asked if I might enter; he opened the door
civilly to me, and I saw him about such a work as for
the curiosity of handling, drawing, and studious exactness,
I never had before seen in all my travels. I
questioned him why he worked in such an obscure and
lonesome place; he told me it was that he might apply
himself to his profession without interruption, and
wondered not a little how I found him out. I asked if
he was unwilling to be made known to some great man,
for that I believed it might turn to his profit; he
answered, he was yet but a beginner, but would not be
sorry to sell off that piece; on demanding the price, he
said Â£100. In good earnest, the very frame was worth
the money, there being nothing in nature so tender and
delicate as the flowers and festoons about it, and yet
the work was very strong; in the piece was more than
one hundred figures of men, etc. I found he was
likewise musical, and very civil, sober, and discreet
in his discourse. There was only an old woman in the
house. So, desiring leave to visit him sometimes, I
went away.</p>

<p>Of this young artist, together with my manner of
finding him out, I acquainted the King, and begged
that he would give me leave to bring him and his work
to Whitehall, for that I would adventure my reputation
with his Majesty that he had never seen anything approach
it, and that he would be exceedingly pleased,
and employ him. The King said he would himself go
see him. This was the first notice his Majesty ever had
of Mr. Gibbon.</p>
