<p>She received the blessed sacrament;
after which, disposing herself to suffer what God should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
determine to inflict, she bore the remainder of her sickness
with extraordinary patience and piety, and more
than ordinary resignation and blessed frame of mind.
She died the 14th, to our unspeakable sorrow and affliction,
and not to our's only, but that of all who knew
her, who were many of the best quality, greatest and
most virtuous persons. The justness of her stature, person,
comeliness of countenance, gracefulness of motion, unaffected,
though more than ordinarily beautiful, were the
least of her ornaments compared with those of her mind.
Of early piety, singularly religious, spending a part of
every day in private devotion, reading, and other virtuous
exercises; she had collected and written out many of
the most useful and judicious periods of the books she
read in a kind of common-place, as out of Dr. Hammond
on the New Testament, and most of the best practical
treatises. She had read and digested a considerable deal
of history, and of places. The French tongue was as
familiar to her as English; she understood Italian, and
was able to render a laudable account of what she read
and observed, to which assisted a most faithful memory
and discernment; and she did make very prudent and
discreet reflections upon what she had observed of the
conversations among which she had at any time been,
which being continually of persons of the best quality,
she thereby improved. She had an excellent voice, to
which she played a thorough-bass on the harpsichord, in
both which she arrived to that perfection, that of the
scholars of those two famous masters, Signors Pietro and
Bartholomeo, she was esteemed the best; for the sweetness
of her voice and management of it added such an
agreeableness to her countenance, without any constraint
or concern, that when she sung, it was as charming to
the eye as to the ear; this I rather note, because it was
a universal remark, and for which so many noble and
judicious persons in music desired to hear her, the last
being at Lord Arundel's, at Wardour.</p>

<p>What shall I say, or rather not say, of the cheerfulness
and agreeableness of her humor? condescending to the
meanest servant in the family, or others, she still kept
up respect, without the least pride. She would often
read to them, examine, instruct, and pray with them if
they were sick, so as she was exceedingly beloved of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
everybody. Piety was so prevalent an ingredient in her
constitution (as I may say), that even among equals and
superiors she no sooner became intimately acquainted,
but she would endeavor to improve them, by insinuating
something religious, and that tended to bring them to a
love of devotion; she had one or two confidants with
whom she used to pass whole days in fasting, reading,
and prayers, especially before the monthly communion,
and other solemn occasions. She abhorred flattery, and,
though she had abundance of wit, the raillery was so innocent
and <a id="tn_png_227"></a><!--TN: "ingenius" changed to "ingenious"-->ingenious that it was most agreeable; she
sometimes would see a play, but since the stage grew
licentious, expressed herself weary of them, and the time
spent at the theater was an unaccountable vanity. She
never played at cards without extreme importunity and
for the company; but this was so very seldom, that I
cannot number it among anything she could name a fault.</p>

<p>No one could read prose or verse better or with more
judgment; and as she read, so she wrote, not only most
correct orthography, with that maturity of judgment and
exactness of the periods, choice of expressions, and
familiarity of style, that some letters of hers have astonished
me and others, to whom she has occasionally
written. She had a talent of rehearsing any comical
part or poem, as to them she might be decently free
with; was more pleasing than heard on the theater; she
danced with the greatest grace I had ever seen, and so
would her master say, who was Monsieur Isaac; but she
seldom showed that perfection, save in the gracefulness
of her carriage, which was with an air of sprightly
modesty not easily to be described. Nothing affected,
but natural and easy as well in her deportment as in her
discourse, which was always material, not trifling, and
to which the extraordinary sweetness of her tone, even
in <a id="tn_png_227a"></a><!--TN: "familar" changed to "familiar"-->familiar speaking, was very charming. Nothing was
so pretty as her descending to play with little children,
whom she would caress and humor with great delight.
But she most affected to be with grave and sober men,
of whom she might learn something, and improve herself.
I have been assisted by her in reading and praying
by me; comprehensive of uncommon notions, curious of
knowing everything to some excess, had I not sometimes
repressed it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing was so delightful to her as to go into my
Study, where she would willingly have spent whole days,
for as I said she had read abundance of history, and all
the best poets, even Terence, Plautus, Homer, Virgil,
Horace, Ovid; all the best romancers and modern poems;
she could compose happily and put in pretty symbols, as
in the "<i>Mundus Muliebris</i>," wherein is an enumeration of
the immense variety of the modes and ornaments belonging
to the sex. But all these are vain trifles to the
virtues which adorned her soul; she was sincerely religious,
most dutiful to her parents, whom she loved with
an affection tempered with great esteem, so as we were
easy and free, and never were so well pleased as when
she was with us, nor needed we other conversation; she
was kind to her sisters, and was still improving them by
her constant course of piety. Oh, dear, sweet, and desirable
child, how shall I part with all this goodness and
virtue without the bitterness of sorrow and reluctancy of
a tender parent! Thy affection, duty and love to me
was that of a friend as well as a child. Nor less dear to
thy mother, whose example and tender care of thee was
unparalleled, nor was thy return to her less conspicuous.
Oh! how she mourns thy loss! how desolate hast thou
left us! To the grave shall we both carry thy memory!
God alone (in whose bosom thou art at rest and happy!)
give us to resign thee and all our contentments (for thou
indeed wert all in this world) to his blessed pleasure!
Let him be glorified by our submission, and give us grace
to bless him for the graces he implanted in thee, thy
virtuous life, pious and holy death, which is indeed the
only comfort of our souls, hastening through the infinite
love and mercy of the Lord Jesus to be shortly with thee,
dear child, and with thee and those blessed saints like
thee, glorify the Redeemer of the world to all eternity!
Amen.</p>

<p>It was in the 19th year of her age that this sickness
happened to her. An accident contributed to this disease;
she had an apprehension of it in particular, which struck
her but two days before she came home, by an imprudent
gentlewoman whom she went with Lady Falkland
to visit, who, after they had been a good while in the
house, told them she has a servant sick of the smallpox
(who indeed died the next day): this my poor child<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
acknowledged made an impression on her <a id="tn_png_229"></a><!--TN: Period added after "spirits" on Page 216-->spirits. There
were four gentlemen of quality offering to treat with me
about marriage, and I freely gave her her own choice,
knowing her discretion. She showed great indifference
to marrying at all, for truly, says she to her mother
(the other day), were I assured of your life and my dear
father's, never would I part from you; I love you and
this home, where we serve God, above all things, nor
ever shall I be so happy; I know and consider the vicissitudes
of the world, I have some experience of its vanities,
and but for decency more than inclination, and that
you judge it expedient for me, I would not change my
condition, but rather add the fortune you design me to
my sisters, and keep up the reputation of our <a id="tn_png_229a"></a><!--TN: Period added after "family" on Page 216-->family.
This was so discreetly and sincerely uttered that it could
not but proceed from an extraordinary child, and one
who loved her parents beyond example.</p>

<p>At London, she took this fatal disease, and the occasion
of her being there was this: my Lord Viscount Falkland's
Lady having been our neighbor (as he was Treasurer
of the Navy), she took so great an affection to my
daughter, that when they went back in the autumn to
the city, nothing would satisfy their incessant importunity
but letting her accompany my Lady, and staying
some time with her; it was with the greatest reluctance I
complied. While she was there, my Lord being musical,
when I saw my Lady would not part with her till Christmas,
I was not unwilling she should improve the opportunity
of learning of Signor Pietro, who had an admirable
way both of composure and teaching. It was the end of
February before I could prevail with my Lady to part
with her; but my Lord going into Oxfordshire to stand
for Knight of the Shire there, she expressed her wish to
come home, being tired of the vain and empty conversation
of the town, the theaters, the court, and trifling
visits which consumed so much precious time, and made
her sometimes miss of that regular course of piety that
gave her the greatest satisfaction. She was weary of
this life, and I think went not thrice to Court all this
time, except when her mother or I carried her. She did
not affect showing herself, she knew the Court well, and
passed one summer in it at Windsor with Lady Tuke,
one of the Queen's women of the bedchamber (a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
virtuous relation of hers); she was not fond of that
glittering scene, now become abominably licentious,
though there was a design of Lady Rochester and Lady
Clarendon to have made her a maid of honor to the
Queen as soon as there was a vacancy. But this she did
not set her heart upon, nor indeed on anything so much
as the service of God, a quiet and regular life, and how
she might improve herself in the most necessary accomplishments,
and to which she was arrived at so great a
measure.</p>

<p>This is the little history and imperfect character of my
dear child, whose piety, virtue, and incomparable endowments
deserve a monument more durable than brass and
marble. Precious is the memorial of the just. Much I
could enlarge on every period of this hasty account, but
that I ease and discharge my overcoming passion for the
present, so many things worthy an excellent Christian
and dutiful child crowding upon me. Never can I say
enough, oh dear, my dear child, whose memory is so
precious to me!</p>

<p>This dear child was born at Wotton, in the same house
and chamber in which I first drew my breath, my wife
having retired to my brother there in the great sickness
that year upon the first of that month, and the very hour
that I was born, upon the last: viz, October.</p>
