<p>The French landed some soldiers at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Teignmouth, in Devon, and burned some poor houses. The
French fleet still hovering about the western coast, and
we having 300 sail of rich merchant-ships in the bay of
Plymouth, our fleet began to move toward them, under
three admirals. The country in the west all on their
guard. A very extraordinary fine season; but on the 12th
was a very great storm of thunder and lightning, and on
the 15th the season much changed to wet and cold.
The militia and trained bands, horse and foot, which
were up through England, were dismissed. The French
King having news that King William was slain, and his
army defeated in Ireland, caused such a triumph at Paris,
and all over France, as was never heard of; when, in the
midst of it, the unhappy King James being vanquished,
by a speedy flight and escape, himself brought the news
of his own defeat.</p>
