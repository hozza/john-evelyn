<p>I went to see the fopperies of the
Papists at Somerset-House and York-House, where now
the French Ambassador had caused to be represented our
Blessed Savior at the Pascal Supper with his disciples,
in figures and puppets made as big as the life, of wax-work,
curiously clad and sitting round a large table, the
room nobly hung, and shining with innumerable lamps
and candles: this was exposed to all the world; all the
city came to see it. Such liberty had the Roman Catholics
at this time obtained.</p>
