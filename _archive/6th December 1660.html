<p>I waited on my brother and sister
Evelyn to Court. Now were presented to his Majesty
those two rare pieces of drollery, or rather a Dutch
Kitchen, painted by Dowe, so finely as hardly to be distinguished
from enamel. I was also shown divers rich
jewels and crystal vases; the rare head of Jo. Bellino,
Titian's master; Christ in the Garden, by Hannibal Caracci;
two incomparable heads, by Holbein; the Queen-Mother
in a miniature, almost as big as the life; an exquisite
piece of carving; two unicorn's horns, etc. This
in the closet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>
