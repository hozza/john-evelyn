<p>The Archbishop of York now died
of the smallpox, aged 62, a corpulent man. He was my
special loving friend, and while Bishop of Rochester
(from whence he was translated) my excellent neighbor.
He was an inexpressible loss to the whole church, and
that Province especially, being a learned, wise, stout,
and most worthy prelate; I look on this as a great stroke
to the poor Church of England, now in this defecting
period.</p>
