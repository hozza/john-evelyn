<p>There was now nothing practical
preached, or that pressed reformation of life, but high
and speculative points and strains that few understood,
which left people very ignorant, and of no steady principles,
the source of all our sects and divisions, for there
was much envy and uncharity in the world; God of his
mercy amend it! Now, indeed, that I went at all to
church, while these usurpers possessed the pulpits, was
that I might not be suspected for a Papist, and that,
though the minister was Presbyterianly affected, he yet
was as I understood duly ordained, and preached sound
doctrine after their way, and besides was an humble,
harmless, and peaceable man.</p>
