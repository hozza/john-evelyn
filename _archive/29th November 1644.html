<p>I a second time visited the
Medicean Palace, being near my lodging, the more exactly
to have a view of the noble collections that adorn
it, especially the bassi-relievi and antique friezes inserted
about the stone work of the house. The Saturn, of metal,
standing in the portico, is a rare piece; so is the Jupiter
and Apollo, in the hall. We were now led into those
rooms above we could not see before, full of incompar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>able
statues and antiquities; above all, and haply preferable
to any in the world, are the Two Wrestlers, for the
inextricable mixture with each other's arms and legs is
stupendous. In the great chamber is the Gladiator, whetting
a knife; but the Venus is without parallel, being
the masterpiece of one whose name you see graven under
it in old Greek characters; nothing in sculpture ever approached
this miracle of art. To this add Marcius, Ganymede,
a little Apollo playing on a pipe; some relievi
incrusted on the palace-walls; and an antique <i>vas</i> of
marble, near six feet high. Among the pictures may be
mentioned the Magdalen and St. Peter, weeping. I pass
over the cabinets and tables of <i>pietra commessa</i>, being
the proper invention of the Florentines. In one of the
chambers is a whimsical chair, which folded into so many
varieties, as to turn into a bed, a bolster, a table, or a
couch. I had another walk in the garden, where are two
huge vases, or baths of stone.</p>

<p>I went further up the hill to the Pope's Palaces at
Monte Cavallo, where I now saw the garden more exactly,
and found it to be one of the most magnificent and pleasant
in Rome. I am told the gardener is annually allowed
2,000 <i>scudi</i> for the keeping of it. Here I observed
hedges of myrtle above a man's height; others of laurel,
oranges, nay, of ivy and juniper; the close walks, and
rustic grotto; a crypt, of which the laver, or basin, is
of one vast, entire, antique porphyry, and below this
flows a plentiful cascade; the steps of the grotto and the
roofs being of rich <a id="tn_png_159"></a><!--TN: "Mosiac" changed to "Mosaic"-->Mosaic. Here are hydraulic organs,
a fish pond, and an ample bath. From hence, we went
to taste some rare Greco; and so home.</p>

<p>Being now pretty weary of continual walking, I kept
within, for the most part, till the 6th of December; and,
during this time, I entertained one Signor Alessandro,
who gave me some lessons on the theorbo.</p>

<p>The next excursion was over the Tiber, which I crossed
in a ferry-boat, to see the Palazzo di Ghisi, standing in
Transtevere, fairly built, but famous only for the painting
<i>รก fresco</i> on the <i>volto</i> of the portico toward the garden;
the story is the Amours of Cupid and Psyche, by the
hand of the celebrated Raphael d'Urbino. Here you always
see painters designing and copying after it, being
esteemed one of the rarest pieces of that art in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
world; and with great reason. I must not omit that incomparable
table of Galatea (as I remember), so carefully
preserved in the cupboard at one of the ends of this
walk, to protect it from the air, being a most lively
painting. There are likewise excellent things of Baldassare,
and others.</p>

<p>Thence we went to the noble house of the Duke of
Bracciano, fairly built, with a stately court and fountain.</p>

<p>Next, we walked to St. Mary's Church, where was the
<i>Taberna Meritoria</i>, where the old Roman soldiers received
their triumphal garland, which they ever after wore.
The high altar is very fair, adorned with columns of
porphyry: here is also some mosaic work about the choir,
and the Assumption is an esteemed piece. It is said
that this church was the first that was dedicated to the
Virgin at Rome. In the opposite piazza is a very sumptuous
fountain.</p>
