<p>To divert me, my Lord would
needs carry me to see Ipswich, when we dined with one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Mr. Mann by the way, who was Recorder of the town.
There were in our company my Lord Huntingtower, son
to the Duchess of Lauderdale, Sir Edward Bacon, a
learned gentleman of the family of the great Chancellor
Verulam, and Sir John Felton, with some other knights
and gentlemen. After dinner came the bailiff and
magistrates in their formalities with their maces to compliment
my Lord, and invite him to the town-house,
where they presented us a collation of dried sweetmeats
and wine, the bells ringing, etc. Then, we went to see
the town, and first, the Lord Viscount Hereford's house,
which stands in a park near the town, like that at Brussels,
in Flanders; the house not great, yet pretty, especially
the hall. The stews for fish succeeded one another,
and feed one the other, all paved at bottom. There is a
good picture of the blessed virgin in one of the parlors,
seeming to be of Holbein, or some good master. Then
we saw the Haven, seven miles from Harwich. The tide
runs out every day, but the bedding being soft mud, it
is safe for shipping and a station. The trade of Ipswich
is for the most part Newcastle coals, with which they
supply London; but it was formerly a clothing town.
There is not any beggar asks alms in the whole place,
a thing very extraordinary, so ordered by the prudence
of the magistrates. It has in it fourteen or fifteen beautiful
churches: in a word, it is for building, cleanness,
and good order, one of the best towns in England. Cardinal
Wolsey was a butcher's son of Ipswich, but there
is little of that magnificent Prelate's foundation here,
besides a school and I think a library, which I did not
see. His intentions were to build some great thing. <span class="sidenote">EUSTON</span>
We returned late to Euston, having traveled about fifty
miles this day.</p>

<p>Since first I was at this place, I found things exceedingly
improved. It is seated in a bottom between two
graceful swellings, the main building being now in the
figure of a Greek II with four pavilions, two at each
corner, and a break in the front, railed and balustered at
the top, where I caused huge jars to be placed full of earth
to keep them steady upon their pedestals between the statues,
which make as good a show as if they were of
stone, and, though the building be of brick, and but
two stories besides cellars and garrets covered with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
blue slate, yet there is room enough for a full court, the
offices and outhouses being so ample and well disposed.
The King's apartment is painted <i>à fresco</i>, and magnificently
furnished. There are many excellent pictures of
the great masters. The gallery is a pleasant, noble
room; in the break, or middle, is a billiard table, but
the wainscot, being of fir, and painted, does not please
me so well as Spanish oak without paint. The chapel is
pretty, the porch descending to the gardens. The orange
garden is very fine, and leads into the greenhouse, at
the end of which is a hall to eat in, and the conservatory
some hundred feet long, adorned with maps, as the
other side is with the heads of the Cæsars, ill cut in
alabaster; above are several apartments for my Lord,
Lady, and Duchess, with kitchens and other offices below,
in a lesser form; lodgings for servants, all distinct
for them to retire to when they please and would be in
private, and have no communication with the palace,
which he tells me he will wholly resign to his son-in-law
and daughter, that charming young creature.</p>

<p>The canal running under my Lady's dressing room
chamber window, is full of carps and fowl, which come
and are fed there. The cascade at the end of the canal
turns a cornmill that provides the family, and raises
water for the fountains and offices. To pass this canal
into the opposite meadows, Sir Samuel Morland has invented
a screw bridge, which, being turned with a key,
lands you fifty feet distant at the entrance of an ascending
walk of trees, a mile in length,—as it is also on the
front into the park,—of four rows of ash trees, and reaches
to the park pale, which is nine miles in compass, and the
best for riding and meeting the game that I ever saw.
There were now of red and fallow deer almost a thousand,
with good covert, but the soil barren and flying
sand, in which nothing will grow kindly. The tufts of
fir, and much of the other wood, were planted by my direction
some years before. This seat is admirably
placed for field sports, hawking, hunting, or racing.
The mutton is small, but sweet. The stables hold thirty
horses and four coaches. The out-offices make two large
quadrangles, so as servants never lived with more ease
and convenience; never master more civil. Strangers
are attended and accommodated as at their home, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
pretty apartments furnished with all manner of conveniences
and privacy.</p>

<p>There is a library full of excellent books; bathing rooms,
elaboratory, dispensary, a decoy, and places to keep and fat
fowl in. He had now in his new church (near the garden)
built a dormitory, or vault, with several repositories,
in which to bury his family.</p>

<p>In the expense of this pious structure, the church is
most laudable, most of the houses of God in this country
resembling rather stables and thatched cottages than
temples in which to serve the Most High. He has built
a lodge in the park for the keeper, which is a neat dwelling,
and might become any gentleman. The same has he
done for the parson, little deserving it for murmuring
that my Lord put him some time out of his wretched
hovel, while it was building. He has also erected a fair
inn at some distance from his palace, with a bridge of
stone over a river near it, and repaired all the tenants'
houses, so as there is nothing but neatness and accommodations
about his estate, which I yet think is not above
£1,500 a year. I believe he had now in his family one
hundred domestic servants.</p>

<p>His lady (being one of the Brederode's daughters,
grandchild to a natural son of Henry Frederick, Prince
of Orange) is a good-natured and obliging woman. They
love fine things, and to live easily, pompously, and hospitably;
but, with so vast expense, as plunges my Lord
into debts exceedingly. My Lord himself is given into
no expensive vice but building, and to have all things
rich, polite, and princely. He never plays, but reads
much, having the Latin, French, and Spanish tongues in
perfection. He has traveled much, and is the best bred
and courtly person his Majesty has about him, so as the
public Ministers more frequent him than any of the rest
of the nobility. While he was Secretary of State and
Prime Minister, he had gotten vastly, but spent it as
hastily, even before he had established a fund to maintain
his greatness; and now beginning to decline in favor
(the Duke being no great friend of his), he knows not
how to retrench. He was son of a Doctor of Laws, whom
I have seen, and, being sent from Westminster School to
Oxford, with intention to be a divine, and parson of Arlington,
a village near Brentford, when Master of Arts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the Rebellion falling out, he followed the King's Army,
and receiving an <span class="small">HONORABLE WOUND IN THE FACE</span>, grew
into favor, and was advanced from a mean fortune, at his
Majesty's Restoration, to be an Earl and Knight of the
Garter, Lord Chamberlain of the Household, and first
favorite for a long time, during which the King married
his natural son, the Duke of Grafton, to his only daughter
and heiress, as before mentioned, worthy for her beauty
and virtue of the greatest prince in Christendom. My
Lord is, besides this, a prudent and understanding person
in business, and speaks well; unfortunate yet in those he
has advanced, most of them proving ungrateful. The
many obligations and civilities I have received from this
noble gentleman, extracts from me this character, and I
am sorry he is in no better circumstances.</p>

<p>Having now passed near three weeks at Euston, to
my great satisfaction, with much difficulty he suffered
me to look homeward, being very earnest with me to
stay longer; and, to engage me, would himself have
carried me to Lynn-Regis, a town of important traffic,
about twenty miles beyond, which I had never seen; as
also the Traveling Sands, about ten miles wide of Euston,
that have so damaged the country, rolling from
place to place, and, like the Sands in the Deserts of
Lybia, quite overwhelmed some gentlemen's whole estates,
as the relation extant in print, and brought to our Society,
describes at <a id="tn_png_132"></a><!--TN: Period added after "large" on Page 119-->large.</p>
