<p>I went with Sir J. Cotton, a Cambridgeshire
Knight, a journey into Normandy. The first
day, we passed by Gaillon, the Archbishop of Rouen's
Palace. The gardens are highly commended, but we did
not go in, intending to reach Pontoise by dinner. This
town is built in a very gallant place, has a noble bridge
over the Oise, and is well refreshed with fountains.</p>

<p>This is the first town in Normandy, and the furthest
that the vineyards extend to on this side of the country,
which is fuller of plains, wood, and inclosures, with some
towns toward the sea, very like England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROUEN</div>

<p>We lay this night at a village, called Magny. The next
day, descending a very steep hill, we dined at Fleury,
after riding five leagues down St. Catherine, to Rouen,
which affords a goodly prospect, to the ruins of that
chapel and mountain. This country so abounds with
wolves that a shepherd whom we met, told us one of his
companions was strangled by one of them the day before,
and that in the midst of his flock. The fields are mostly
planted with pears and apples, and other cider fruits. It
is plentifully furnished with quarries of stone and slate,
and hath iron in abundance.</p>

<p>I lay at the White Cross, in Rouen, which is a very
large city, on the Seine, having two smaller rivers besides,
called the Aubette and Robec. There stand yet
the ruins of a magnificent bridge of stone, now supplied
by one of boats only, to which come up vessels of considerable
burden. The other side of the water consists
of meadows, and there have the Reformed a church.</p>

<p>The Cathedral Nôtre Dame was built, as they acknowledge,
by the English; some English words graven in
Gothic characters upon the front seem to confirm it. The
towers and whole church are full of carving. It has three
steeples, with a pyramid; in one of these, I saw the
famous bell so much talked of, thirteen feet in height,
thirty-two round, the diameter eleven, weighing 40,000
pounds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Chapel d'Amboise, built by a Cardinal of that
name, lies his body, with several fair monuments. The
choir has behind it a great dragon painted on the wall,
which they say had done much harm to the inhabitants,
till vanquished by St. Romain, their Archbishop; for which
there is an annual procession. It was now near Easter,
and many images were exposed with scenes and stories
representing the Passion; made up of little puppets, to
which there was great resort and devotion, with offerings.
Before the church is a fair palace. St. Ouen is another
goodly church and an abbey with fine gardens. Here the
King hath lodgings, when he makes his progress through
these parts. The structure, where the Court of Parliament
is kept, is very magnificent, containing very fair
halls and chambers, especially La Chambre Dorée. The
town-house is also well built, and so are some gentlemen's
houses; but most part of the rest are of timber,
like our merchants' in London, in the wooden part of the
city.</p>
