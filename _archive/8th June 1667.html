<p>To London, alarmed by the Dutch,
who were fallen on our fleet at Chatham, by a most
audacious enterprise, entering the very river with part of
their fleet, doing us not only disgrace, but incredible mischief
in burning several of our best men-of-war lying at
anchor and moored there, and all this through our unaccountable
negligence in not setting out our fleet in due
time. This alarm caused me, fearing the enemy might
venture up the Thames even to London (which they
might have done with ease, and fired all the vessels in
the river, too), to send away my best goods, plate, etc.,
from my house to another place. The alarm was so great
that it put both country and city into fear, panic, and
consternation, such as I hope I shall never see more;
everybody was flying, none knew why or whither. Now,
there were land forces dispatched with the Duke of Albemarle,
Lord Middleton, Prince Rupert, and the Duke, to
hinder the Dutch coming to Chatham, fortifying Upnor
Castle, and laying chains and bombs; but the resolute
enemy broke through all, and set fire on our ships, and
retreated in spite, stopping up the Thames, the rest of the
fleet lying before the mouth of it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
