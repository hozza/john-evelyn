<p>Was spent in hearing several exercises
in the schools; and, after dinner, the Proctor opened the
Act at St. Mary's (according to custom), and the Prevaricators,
their drollery. Then, the Doctors disputed. We
supped at Wadham College.</p>

<p>9th <a id="tn_png_322"></a><!--TN: "June" changed to "July"-->July, 1654. Dr. French preached at St. Mary's,
on Matt. xii. 42, advising the students the search after
true wisdom, not to be had in the books of philosophers,
but in the Scriptures alone. In the afternoon, the famous
Independent, Dr. Owen, perstringing Episcopacy.
He was now Cromwell's Vice-Chancellor. We dined with
Dr. Ward, Mathematical Professor (since Bishop of Sarum),
and at night supped in Baliol College Hall, where I had
once been student and fellow-commoner, and where they
made me extraordinarily welcome.</p>

<p>10th <a id="tn_png_322a"></a><!--TN: "June" changed to "July"-->July, 1654. On Monday, I went again to the
schools, to hear the several faculties, and in the afternoon
tarried out the whole Act in St. Mary's, the long
speeches of the Proctors, the Vice-Chancellor, the several
Professors, creation of Doctors, by the cap, ring, kiss,
etc., those ancient ceremonies and institution being as
yet not wholly abolished. Dr. Kendal, now Inceptor
among others, performing his Act incomparably well,
concluded it with an excellent oration, abating his Presbyterian
animosities, which he withheld, not even against
that learned and pious divine, Dr. Hammond. The Act
was closed with the speech of the Vice-Chancellor, there
being but four in theology, and three in medicine, which
was thought a considerable matter, the times considered.
I dined at one Monsieur Fiat's, a student of Exeter
College, and supped at a magnificent entertainment of
Wadham Hall, invited by my dear and excellent friend,
Dr. Wilkins, then Warden (after, Bishop of Chester).</p>
