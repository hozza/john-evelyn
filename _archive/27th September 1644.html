<p>We rode by Pont Charu to
Lyons, which being but six leagues we soon accomplished,
having made eighty-five leagues from Tours in
seven days. Here at the Golden Lion, rue de Flandre, I
met divers of my acquaintance, who, coming from Paris,
were designed for Italy. We lost no time in seeing the
city, because of being ready to accompany these gentlemen
in their journey. Lyons is excellently situated on
the confluence of the rivers Soane and Rhone, which
wash the walls of the city in a very rapid stream; each
of these has its bridge; that over the Rhone consists of
twenty-eight arches. The two high cliffs, called St. Just
and St. Sebastian, are very stately; on one of them stands
a strong fort, garrisoned. We visited the cathedral, St.
Jean, where was one of the fairest clocks for art and
busy invention I had ever seen. The fabric of the
church is gothic, as are likewise those of St. Etienne and
St. Croix. From the top of one of the towers of St.
Jean (for it has four) we beheld the whole city and
country, with a prospect reaching to the Alps, many
leagues distant. The Archbishop's palace is fairly built.
The church of St. Nisier is the greatest; that of the
Jacobins is well built. Here are divers other fine
churches and very noble buildings we had not time to
visit, only that of the Charit√©, or great hospital for poor,
infirm people, entertaining about 1,500 souls, with a school,
granary, gardens, and all conveniences, maintained at a
wonderful expense, worthy seeing. The place of the <i>Belle
Cour</i> is very spacious, observable for the view it affords,
so various and agreeable, of hills, rocks, vineyards, gardens,
precipices, and other extravagant and incomparable
advantages presenting themselves together. The Pall
Mall is set with fair trees. In fine, this stately, clean,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and noble city, built all of stone, abounds in persons of
quality and rich merchants: those of Florence obtaining
great privileges above the rest. In the Town-house, they
show two tables of brass, on which is engraven Claudius's
speech, pronounced to the Senate, concerning the franchising
of the town, with the Roman privileges. There
are also other antiquities.</p>
