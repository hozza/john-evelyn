<p>I was at the funeral of old Mr. Shish,
master-shipwright of his Majesty's Yard here, an honest
and remarkable man, and his death a public loss, for his
excellent success in building ships (though altogether
illiterate), and for breeding up so many of his children
to be able artists. I held up the pall with three knights,
who did him that honor, and he was worthy of it. It
was the custom of this good man to rise in the night,
and to pray, kneeling in his own coffin, which he had lying
by him for many years. He was born that famous year,
the Gunpowder-plot, 1605.</p>
