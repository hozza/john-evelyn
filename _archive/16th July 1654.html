<p>We went to another uncle and relative
of my wife's, Sir John Glanville, a famous lawyer,
formerly Speaker of the House of Commons; his seat is
at Broad Hinton, where he now lived but in the gate-house,
his very fair dwelling house having been burnt
by his own hands, to prevent the rebels making a garrison
of it. Here, my cousin William Glanville's eldest son
showed me such a lock for a door, that for its filing,
and rare contrivances was a masterpiece, yet made by
a country blacksmith. But, we have seen watches made
by another with as much curiosity as the best of that
profession can brag of; and, not many years after, there
was nothing more frequent than all sorts of ironwork
more exquisitely wrought and polished than in any part
of Europe, so as a door lock of a tolerable price was esteemed
a curiosity even among foreign princes.</p>

<p>Went back to Cadenham, and, on the 19th, to Sir
Edward Baynton's at Spie Park, a place capable of being
made a noble seat; but the humorous old knight has
built a long single house of two low stories on the precipice
of an incomparable prospect, and landing on a bowling-green
in the park. The house is like a long barn, and
has not a window on the prospect side. After dinner,
they went to bowls, and, in the <a id="tn_png_325"></a><!--TN: "meantine" changed to "meantime"-->meantime, our coachmen
were made so exceedingly drunk, that in returning home
we escaped great dangers. This, it seems, was by order
of the knight, that all gentlemen's servants be so treated;
but the custom is barbarous, and much unbecoming a
knight still less a Christian.</p>
