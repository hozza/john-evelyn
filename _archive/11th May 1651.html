<p>To the Palace Cardinal, where the Master
of the Ceremonies placed me to see the royal masque,
or opera. The first scene represented a chariot of singers
composed of the rarest voices that could be procured,
representing Cornaro<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_42_42">42</a> and Temperance; this was overthrown
by Bacchus and his revelers; the rest consisted
of several entries and pageants of excess, by all the elements.
A masque representing fire was admirable; then
came a Venus out of the clouds. The conclusion was a
heaven, whither all ascended. But the glory of the masque
was the great persons performing in it, the French King,
his brother the Duke of Anjou, with all the grandees of
the Court, the King performing to the admiration of all.
The music was twenty-nine violins, vested <i>Ã  l'antique</i>,
but the habits of the masquers were stupendously rich
and glorious.</p>
