<p>I walked in the morning up the
hill toward the Capuchins, where was then Cardinal Unufrio
(brother to the late Pope Urban VIII.) of the same order.
He built them a pretty church, full of rare pictures,
and there lies the body of St. Felix, that they say still
does miracles. The piece at the great altar is by <a id="tn_png_193"></a><!--TN: "Lanframe" changed to "Lanfranc"-->Lanfranc.
It is a lofty edifice, with a beautiful avenue of
trees, and in a good air. After dinner, passing along the
Strada del Corso, I observed the column of Antoninus,
passing under Arco Portugallo, which is but a relic, heretofore
erected in honor of Domitian, called now Portugallo,
from a Cardinal living near it. A little further on
the right hand stands the column in a small piazza, here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>tofore
set up in honor of M. Aurelius Antoninus, comprehending
in a basso-relievo of white marble his hostile
acts against the Parthians, Armenians, Germans, etc;
but it is now somewhat decayed. On the summit has
been placed the image of St. Paul, of gilded copper.
The pillar is said to be 161 feet high, ascended by 207
steps, receiving light by fifty-six apertures, without defacing
the sculpture.</p>

<p>At a little distance, are the relics of the Emperor's
palace, the heads of whose pillars show them to have
been Corinthian.</p>

<p>Turning a little down, we came to another piazza, in
which stands a sumptuous vase of porphyry, and a fair
fountain; but the grace of this market, and indeed the
admiration of the whole world, is the Pantheon, now called
S. Maria della Rotonda, formerly sacred to all the Gods,
and still remaining the most entire antiquity of the city.
It was built by Marcus Agrippa, as testifies the architrave
of the portico, sustained by thirteen pillars of Theban
marble, six feet thick, and fifty-three in height, of one
entire stone. In this porch is an old inscription.</p>

<p>Entering the church, we admire the fabric, wholly
covered with one cupola, seemingly suspended in the air,
and receiving light by a hole in the middle only. The
structure is near as high as broad, viz, 144 feet, not
counting the thickness of the walls, which is twenty-two
more to the top, all of white marble; and, till Urban
<a id="tn_png_194"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period after "VIII"-->VIII. converted part of the metal into ordnance of war
against the Duke of Parma, and part to make the high
altar in St. Peter's, it was all over covered with Corinthian
brass, ascending by forty degrees within the roof, or
convex, of the cupola, richly carved in octagons in the
stone. There are niches in the walls, in which stood
heretofore the statues of Jupiter and the other Gods and
Goddesses; for here was that Venus which had hung in
her ear the other Union<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_28_28">28</a> that Cleopatra was about to dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>solve
and drink up, as she had done its fellow. There
are several of these niches, one above another for the
celestial, terrestrial, and subterranean deities; but the
place is now converted into a church dedicated to the
Blessed Virgin and all the Saints. The pavement is excellent,
and the vast folding-gates, of Corinthian brass.
In a word, it is of all the Roman antiquities the most
worthy of notice. There lie interred in this Temple the
famous Raphael di Urbino, Perino del Vaga, F. Zuccharo,
and other painters.</p>

<p>Returning home, we pass by Cardinal Cajetan's Palace,
a noble piece of architecture of Vincenzo Ammanatti,
which is the grace of the whole Corso.</p>
