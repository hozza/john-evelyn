<p>I was invited to the College of
Physicians, where Dr. Meret, a learned man and library-keeper,
showed me the library, theater for anatomy, and
divers natural curiosities; the statue and epigram under
it of that renowned physician, Dr. Harvey, discoverer
of the circulation of the blood. There I saw Dr. Gilbert,
Sir William Paddy's and other pictures of men famous
in their faculty.</p>

<p>Visited Mr. Wright, a Scotchman, who had lived long
at Rome, and was esteemed a good painter. The
pictures of the Judges at Guildhall are of his hand, and
so are some pieces in Whitehall, as the roof in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
Majesty's old bedchamber, being Astræa, the <a id="tn_png_399"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period after "St"-->St. Catherine,
and a chimney-piece in the Queen's privy chamber; but
his best, in my opinion, is Lacy, the famous Roscius or
comedian, whom he has painted in three dresses, as a
gallant, a Presbyterian minister, and a Scotch highlander
in his plaid. It is in his Majesty's dining room at
Windsor. He had at his house an excellent collection,
especially that small piece of Correggio, Scotus of de
la Marca, a design of Paulo; and, above all, those ruins
of Polydore, with some good agates and medals, especially
a Scipio, and a Cæsar's head of gold.</p>
