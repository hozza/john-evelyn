<p>Dined at the Lord Chancellor's,
where was the Duke of Ormond, Earl of Cork, and Bishop
of Winchester. After dinner, my Lord Chancellor and
his lady carried me in their coach to see their palace
(for he now lived at Worcester-House in the Strand),
building at the upper end of St. James's street, and to
project the garden. In the evening, I presented him
with my book on Architecture,<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_81_81">81</a> as before I had done to
his Majesty and the Queen-Mother. His lordship caused
me to stay with him in his bedchamber, discoursing of
several matters very late, even till he was going into his bed.</p>
