<p>Dined with Mr. Pepys, who the next
day was sent to the Gatehouse,<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_74_74">74</a> and several great persons
to the Tower, on suspicion of being affected to King
James; among them was the Earl of Clarendon, the Queen's
uncle. King William having vanquished King James in
Ireland, there was much public rejoicing. It seems the
Irish in King James's army would not stand, but the
English-Irish and French made great resistance. Schomberg
was slain, and Dr. Walker, who so bravely defended
Londonderry. King William received a slight wound by
the grazing of a cannon bullet on his shoulder, which he
endured with very little interruption of his pursuit. Hamilton,
who broke his word about Tyrconnel, was taken.
It is reported that King James is gone back to France.
Drogheda and Dublin surrendered, and if King William
be returning, we may say of him as CÃ¦sar said, "<i>Veni,
vidi, vici</i>." But to alloy much of this, the French fleet
rides in our channel, ours not daring to interpose, and
the enemy threatening to land.</p>
