<p>I went to congratulate the arrival of
that worthy and excellent person my Lord Galway, newly
come out of Ireland, where he had behaved himself so
honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the people:
but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman,
though they had not a more worthy, valiant, discreet,
and trusty person in the two kingdoms, on whom they
could have relied for his conduct and fitness. He was
one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his
father, for being Protestants.</p>

<p>July, 1701. My Lord Treasurer made my grandson
one of the Commissioners of the prizes, salary Â£500 per
annum.</p>
