<p>There were delivered to me two
letters from the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, with the
Decree of the Convocation, attested by the Public Notary,
ordering four Doctors of Divinity and Law to acknowledge
the obligation the University had to me for procuring the
<i>Marmora Arundeliana</i>, which was solemnly done by Dr.
Barlow, Dr. Jenkins, Judge of the Admiralty, Dr. Lloyd,
and Obadiah Walker, of University College, who having
made a large compliment from the University, delivered
me the decree fairly written;</p>

<p><i>Gesta venerabili domo Convocationis Universitatis Oxon.; . . 17.
1667. Quo die retulit ad Senatum Academicum Dominus Vicecancellarius,
quantum Universitas deberet singulari benevolentiæ Johannis
Evelini Armigeri, qui pro eâ pietate quâ Almam Matrem prosequitur
non solum Suasu et Consilio apud inclytum Heroem Henricum Howard,
Ducis Norfolciæ hæredem, intercessit, et Universitati pretiosissimum
eruditæ antiquitatis thesaurum Marmora Arundeliana largiretur; sed
egregium insuper in ijs colligendis asservandisq; navavit operam: Quapropter
unanimi suffragio Venerabilis Domûs decretum est, at eidem
publicæ gratiæ per delegatos ad Honoratissimum Dominum Henricum
Howard propediem mittendos solemnitèr reddantur.</i></p>

<p>"We intend also a noble inscription, in which also honorable mention
shall be made of yourself; but Mr. Vice-Chancellor commands me to
tell you that that was not sufficient for your merits; but, that if your
occasions would permit you to come down at the Act (when we intend
a dedication of our new Theater), some other testimony should be given
both of your own worth and affection to this your old mother; for we
are all very sensible that this great addition of learning and reputation
to the University is due as well to your industrious care for the University,
and interest with my Lord Howard, as to his great nobleness and
generosity of spirit.</p>

<p>The Vice-Chancellor's letter to the same effect was too
vainglorious to insert, with divers copies of verses that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
were also sent me. Their mentioning me in the inscription
I totally declined, when I directed the titles of Mr.
Howard, now made Lord, upon his Ambassage to
Morocco.</p>

<p>These four doctors, having made me this compliment,
desired me to carry and introduce them to Mr. Howard,
at Arundel House; which I did, Dr. Barlow (Provost of
Queen's) after a short speech, delivering a larger letter of
the University's thanks, which was written in Latin, expressing
the great sense they had of the honor done them.
After this compliment handsomely performed and as nobly

coach. That evening I supped with them.</p>
