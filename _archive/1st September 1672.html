<p>I spent this week in soliciting
for moneys, and in reading to my Lord Clifford my papers
relating to the first Holland war. Now, our Council of
Plantations met at Lord Shaftesbury's (Chancellor of the
Exchequer) to read and reform the draft of our new
Patent, joining the Council of Trade to our political capacities.
After this, I returned home, in order to another
excursion to the seaside, to get as many as possible
of the men who were recovered on board the fleet.</p>
