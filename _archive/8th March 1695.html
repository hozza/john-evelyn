<p>I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield
and Coventry's, who related to me the pious behavior of
the Queen in all her sickness, which was admirable. She
never inquired of what opinion persons were, who were
objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
was found wherein she had desired that her body might
not be opened, or any extraordinary expense at her funeral,
whenever she should die. This paper was not found
in time to be observed. There were other excellent
things under her own hand, to the very least of her
debts, which were very small, and everything in that
exact method, as seldom is found in any private person.
In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating
for taking the Crown without a more due apology,
as does, if possible, outdo the renowned Queen Elizabeth.</p>
