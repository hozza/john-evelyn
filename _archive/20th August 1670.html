<p>At Windsor I supped with the
Duke of Monmouth; and, the next day, invited by Lord
Arlington, dined with the same Duke and divers Lords.
After dinner my Lord and I had a conference of more
than an hour alone in his bedchamber, to engage me
in the History. I showed him something that I had
drawn up, to his great satisfaction, and he desired me to
show it to the Treasurer.</p>
