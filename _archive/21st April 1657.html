<p>Came Sir Thomas Hanmer, of Hanmer,
in Wales, to see me. I then waited on my Lord
Hatton, with whom I dined: at my return, I stepped into
Bedlam, where I saw several poor, miserable creatures
in chains; one of them was mad with making verses. I
also visited the Charter House, formerly belonging to
the Carthusians, now an old, neat, fresh, solitary college
for decayed gentlemen. It has a grove, bowling green,
garden, chapel, and a hall where they eat in common.
I likewise saw Christ Church and Hospital, a very good
Gothic building; the hall, school, and lodgings in great
order for bringing up many hundreds of poor children
of both sexes; it is an exemplary charity. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
large picture at one end of the hall, representing the
governors, founders, and the institution.</p>
