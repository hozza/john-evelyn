learned priest and famous philosopher,<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_43_43">43</a> author of the book
"De Mundo," with whose worthy brother I was well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
acquainted at Rome. I was shown a cabinet of Maroquin, or
