<p>I went to see the college and
schools, which are nothing extraordinary, and was complimented
with a <i>matricula</i> by the <i>magnificus</i> Professor,
who first in Latin demanded of me where my lodging in
the town was, my name, age, birth, and to what Faculty
I addicted myself; then, recording my answers in a book,
he administered an oath to me that I should observe the
statutes and orders of the University while I stayed,
and then delivered me a ticket, by virtue whereof I was
made excise-free; for all which worthy privileges, and
the pains of writing, he accepted of a rix-dollar.</p>

<p>Here was now the famous Dan. Heinsius, whom I so
longed to see, as well as the no less famous printer,
Elzevir's printing-house and shop, renowned for the
politeness of the character and editions of what he
has published through Europe. Hence to the physic-garden,
well stored with exotic plants, if the catalogue
presented to me by the gardener be a faithful register.</p>

<p>But, among all the rarities of this place, I was much
pleased with a sight of their anatomy-school, theater, and
repository adjoining, which is well furnished with natural
curiosities; skeletons, from the whale and elephant to the
fly and spider; which last is a very delicate piece of art,
to see how the bones (if I may so call them of so tender
an insect) could be separated from the mucilaginous
parts of that minute animal. Among a great variety of
other things, I was shown the knife newly taken out of
a drunken Dutchman's guts, by an incision in his side,
after it had slipped from his fingers into his stomach.
The pictures of the chirurgeon and his patient, both living,
were there.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>There is without the town a fair Mall, curiously
planted.</p>

<p>Returning to my lodging, I was showed the statue,
cut in stone, of the happy monk, whom they report to
have been the first inventor of typography, set over the
door; but this is much controverted by others, who strive
for the glory of it, besides John Gutenberg.</p>

<p>I was brought acquainted with a Burgundian Jew, who
had married an apostate Kentish woman. I asked him
divers questions: he told me, among other things, that
the World should never end; that our souls transmigrated,
and that even those of the most holy persons did penance
in the bodies of brutes after death,â€”and so he interpreted
the banishment and savage life of Nebuchadnezzar:
that all the Jews should rise again, and be led to Jerusalem;
that the Romans only were the occasion of our
Savior's death, whom he affirmed (as the Turks do) to
be a great prophet, but not the Messiah. He showed me
several books of their devotion, which he had translated
into English, for the instruction of his wife; he told me
that when the Messiah came, all the ships, barks, and
vessels of Holland should, by the power of certain strange
whirlwinds, be loosed from their anchors, and transported
in a moment to all the desolate ports and havens throughout
the world, wherever the dispersion was, to convey
their brethren and tribes to the Holy City; with other
such like stuff. He was a merry drunken fellow, but
would by no means handle any money (for something I
purchased of him), it being Saturday; but desired me to
leave it in the window, meaning to receive it on Sunday
morning.</p>
