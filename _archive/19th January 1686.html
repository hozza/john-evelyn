<p>Passed the Privy Seal, among
others, the creation of Mrs. Sedley (concubine to ——)
Countess of Dorchester, which the Queen took very grievously,
so as for two dinners, standing near her, I observed
she hardly ate one morsel, nor spoke one word to the
King, or to any about her, though at other times she
used to be extremely pleasant, full of discourse and good
humor. The Roman Catholics were also very angry:
because they had so long valued the sanctity of their
religion and proselytes.</p>

<p>Dryden, the famous playwriter, and his two sons, and
Mrs. Nelly (miss to the late ——), were said to go to
mass; such proselytes were no great loss to the Church.</p>

<p>This night was burnt to the ground my Lord Montague's
palace in Bloomsbury, than which for painting
and furniture there was nothing more glorious in England.
This happened by the negligence of a servant airing, as
they call it, some of the goods by the fire in a moist
season; indeed, so wet and mild a season had scarce been
seen in man's memory.</p>

<p>At this Seal there also passed the creation of Sir Henry
Waldegrave to be a Peer. He had married one of the
King's natural daughters by Mrs. Churchill. These two
Seals my brother Commissioners passed in the morning
before I came to town, at which I was not displeased.
We likewise passed Privy Seals for £276,000 upon several
accounts, pensions, guards, wardrobes, privy purse,
etc., besides divers pardons, and one more which I must
not forget (and which by Providence I was not present at)
one Mr. Lytcott to be Secretary to the Ambassador to
Rome. We being three Commissioners, any two were a
quorum.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
