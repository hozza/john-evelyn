<p>I saw the magnificent entry of the
French Ambassador Colbert, received in the banqueting
house. I had never seen a richer coach than that which
he came in to Whitehall. Standing by his Majesty at
dinner in the presence, there was of that rare fruit called
the king-pine, growing in Barbadoes and the West Indies;
the first of them I had ever seen. His Majesty having
cut it up, was pleased to give me a piece off his own
plate to taste of; but, in my opinion, it falls short of those
ravishing varieties of deliciousness described in Captain
Ligon's history, and others; but possibly it might, or certainly
was, much impaired in coming so far; it has yet a
grateful acidity, but tastes more like the quince and melon
than of any other fruit he mentions.</p>
