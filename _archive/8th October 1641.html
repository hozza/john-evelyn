<p>I passed by a boat to Bruges, taking
in at a redoubt a convoy of fourteen musketeers, because
the other side of the river, being Contribution-land, was
subject to the inroads and depredations of the bordering
States. This river was cut by the famous Marquis Spinola,
and is in my judgment a wonderful piece of labor,
and a worthy public work, being in some places forced
through the main rock, to an incredible depth, for thirty
miles. At the end of each mile is built a small redoubt,
which communicates a line to the next, and so the whole
way, from whence we received many volleys of shot, in
compliment to my Lord Marshal, who was in our vessel,
a passenger with us. At five that evening, we were met
by the magistrates of Bruges, who came out to convey my
Lord to his lodgings, at whose cost he was entertained
that night.</p>

<p>The morning after we went to see the Stadt-house and
adjoining aqueduct, the church, and market-place, where
we saw cheeses and butter piled up in heaps; also the
fortifications and graffs, which are extremely large.</p>

<p>The 9th, we arrived at Ostend by a straight and artificial
river. Here, with leave of the captain of the watch,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
I was carried to survey the river and harbor, with fortifications
on one side thereof: the east and south are mud
and earth walls. It is a very strong place, and lately
stood a memorable siege three years, three months, three
weeks, and three days. I went to see the church of St.
Peter, and the cloisters of the Franciscans.</p>
