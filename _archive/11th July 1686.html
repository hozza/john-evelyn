<p>Dr. Meggot, Dean of Winchester
preached before the household in St. George's Chapel at
Windsor, the late King's glorious chapel now seized on
by the mass priests. Dr. Cartwright, Dean of Ripon,
preached before the great men of the Court in the same
place.</p>

<p>We had now the sad news of the Bishop of Oxford's
death, an extraordinary loss to the poor Church at this
time. Many candidates for his Bishopric and Deanery,
Dr. Parker, South, Aldrich, etc. Dr. Walker (now apostatizing)
came to Court, and was doubtless very busy.</p>
