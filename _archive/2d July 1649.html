<p>I went from Wotton to Godstone (the
residence of Sir John Evelyn), where was also Sir John
Evelyn of Wilts., when I took leave of both Sir Johns
and their ladies. Mem. the prodigious memory of Sir
John of Wilts' daughter, since married to Mr.Â W. Pierrepont,
and mother of the present Earl of Kingston. I
returned to Sayes Court this night.</p>
