<p>Visited the Lord Chancellor, to whom
his Majesty had sent for the seals a few days before; I
found him in his bedchamber, very sad. The Parliament
had accused him, and he had enemies at Court, especially
the buffoons and ladies of pleasure, because he thwarted
some of them, and stood in their way; I could name some
of the chief. The truth is, he made few friends during
his grandeur among the royal sufferers, but advanced the
old rebels. He was, however, though no considerable lawyer,
one who kept up the form and substance of things
in the Nation with more solemnity than some would have
had. He was my particular kind friend, on all occasions.
The cabal, however, prevailed, and that party in Parliament.
Great division at Court concerning him, and divers
great persons interceding for him.</p>
