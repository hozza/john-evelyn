<p>We heard the speeches, and saw the
ceremony of creating doctors in Divinity, Law and
Physic. I had, early in the morning, heard Dr. Morison,
Botanic Professor, read on divers plants in the Physic
Garden; and saw that rare collection of natural curiosities
of Dr. Plot's, of Magdalen Hall, author of "The Natural
History of Oxfordshire," all of them collected in that
shire, and indeed extraordinary, that in one county there
should be found such variety of plants, shells, stones,
minerals, marcasites, fowls, insects, models of works,
crystals, agates, and marbles. He was now intending to
visit Staffordshire, and, as he had of Oxfordshire, to give
us the natural, topical, political, and mechanical history.
Pity it is that more of this industrious man's genius
were not employed so to describe every county of England;
it would be one of the most useful and illustrious
works that was ever produced in any age or nation.</p>

<p>I visited also the Bodleian Library and my old friend,
the learned Obadiah Walker, head of University College,
which he had now almost rebuilt, or repaired. We then
proceeded to Northampton, where we arrived the next
day.</p>

<p>In this journey, went part of the way Mr. James Graham
(since Privy Purse to the Duke), a young gentleman
exceedingly in love with Mrs. Dorothy Howard, one of the
maids of honor in our company. I could not but pity
them both, the mother not much favoring it. This lady
was not only a great beauty, but a most virtuous and
excellent creature, and worthy to have been wife to the
best of men. My advice was required, and I spoke to
the advantage of the young gentleman, more out of pity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
than that she deserved no better match; for, though he
was a gentleman of good family, yet there was great inequality.</p>

<p>14th July, <a id="tn_png_118"></a><!--TN: Period added after "1675"-->1675. I went to see my Lord Sunderland's
Seat at Althorpe, four miles from the ragged town of
Northampton (since burned, and well rebuilt). It is
placed in a pretty open bottom, very finely watered and
flanked with stately woods and groves in a park, with a
canal, but the water is not running, which is a defect.
The house, a kind of modern building, of freestone,
within most nobly furnished; the apartments very commodious,
a gallery and noble hall; but the kitchen being
in the body of the house, and chapel too small, were defects.
There is an old yet honorable gatehouse standing
awry, and out-housing mean, but designed to be taken
away. It was moated round, after the old manner, but
it is now dry, and turfed with a beautiful carpet. Above
all, are admirable and magnificent the several ample gardens
furnished with the choicest fruit, and exquisitely
kept. Great plenty of oranges, and other curiosities.
The park full of fowl, especially herons, and from it a
prospect to Holmby House, which being demolished in
the late civil wars, shows like a Roman ruin shaded by
the trees about it, a stately, solemn, and pleasing view.</p>
