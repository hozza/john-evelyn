<p>I saw a great auction of pictures in
the Banqueting house, Whitehall. They had been my
Lord Melford's, now Ambassador from King James at
Rome, and engaged to his creditors here. Lord Mulgrave
and Sir Edward Seymour came to my house, and desired
me to go with them to the sale. Divers more of the
great lords, etc., were there, and bought pictures dear
enough. There were some very excellent of Vandyke,
Rubens, and Bassan. Lord Godolphin bought the picture
of the Boys, by Murillo the Spaniard, for 80 guineas,
dear enough; my nephew Glanville, the old Earl of
Arundel's head by Rubens, for Â£20. Growing late, I did
not stay till all were sold.</p>
