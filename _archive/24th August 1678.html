<p>I went to see my Lord of St. Alban's
house, at Byfleet, an old, large building. Thence,
to the papermills, where I found them making a coarse
white paper. They cull the rags which are linen for
white paper, woolen for brown; then they stamp them
in troughs to a pap, with pestles, or hammers, like the
powder mills, then put it into a vessel of water, in which
they dip a frame closely wired with wire as small as a
hair and as close as a weaver's reed; on this they take
up the pap, the superfluous water draining through the
wire; this they dexterously turning, shake out like a pancake
on a smooth board between two pieces of flannel,
then press it between a great press, the flannel sucking
out the moisture; then, taking it out, they ply and dry
it on strings, as they dry linen in the laundry; then dip
it in alum water, lastly, polish and make it up in quires.
They put some gum in the water in which they macerate
the rags. The mark we find on the sheets is formed
in the wire.</p>
