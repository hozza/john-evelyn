<p>We rested ourselves; and next day, in
a coach, took our last farewell of visiting the circumjacent
places, going to Tivoli, or the old Tiburtum. At
about six miles from Rome, we pass the Teverone, a
bridge built by Mammea, the mother of Severus, and so
by divers ancient sepulchres, among others that of Valerius
Volusi; and near it past the <a id="tn_png_205a"></a><!--TN: "sinking" changed to "stinking"-->stinking <a id="tn_png_205"></a><!--TN: "suphurous" changed to "sulphurous"-->sulphurous
river over the Ponte Lucano, where we found a heap, or
turret, full of inscriptions, now called the Tomb of
Plautius. Arrived at Tivoli, we went first to see the
palace d'Este, erected on a plain, but where was formerly
an hill. The palace is very ample and stately. In
the garden, on the right hand, are sixteen vast conchas
of marble, jetting out waters; in the midst of these
stands a Janus quadrifrons, that cast forth four girandolas,
called from the resemblance (to a particular exhibition
in fireworks so named) the Fountana di Spéccho (looking-glass).
Near this is a place for tilting. Before the
ascent of the palace is the famous fountain of Leda, and
not far from that, four sweet and delicious gardens.
Descending thence are two pyramids of water, and in a
grove of trees near it the fountains of Tethys, Esculapius,
Arethusa, Pandora, Pomona, and Flora; then the
prancing <a id="tn_png_205b"></a><!--TN: Comma added after "Pegasus"-->Pegasus, Bacchus, the Grot of Venus, the two
Colosses of Melicerta and Sibylla Tiburtina, all of exquisite
marble, copper, and other suitable adornments.
The Cupids pouring out water are especially most rare,
and the urns on which are placed the ten nymphs. The
grots are richly paved with <i>pietra-commessa</i>, shells, coral,
etc.</p>

<p>Toward Roma Triumphans, leads a long and spacious
walk, full of fountains, under which is historized the
whole Ovidian Metamorphosis, in rarely sculptured <i>mezzo
relievo</i>. At the end of this, next the wall, is the city of
Rome as it was in its beauty, of small models, representing
that city, with its amphitheatres; naumachi,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
thermæ, temples, arches, aqueducts, streets, and other
magnificences, with a little stream running through it for
the Tiber, gushing out of an urn next to the statue of
the river. In another garden, is a noble aviary, the birds
artificial, and singing till an owl appears, on which they
suddenly change their notes. Near this is the fountain
of dragons, casting out large streams of water with great
noise. In another grotto, called Grotto di Natura, is an
hydraulic organ; and below this are divers stews and
fish ponds, in one of which is the statue of Neptune in
his chariot on a seahorse, in another a Triton; and lastly,
a garden of simples. There are besides in the palace
many rare statues and pictures, bedsteads richly inlaid,
and sundry other precious movables: the whole is said
to have cost the best part of a million.</p>

<p>Having gratified our curiosity with these artificial
miracles, and dined, we went to see the so famous natural
precipice and cascade of the river Anio, rushing down
from the mountains of Tivoli with that fury that, what
with the mist it perpetually casts up by the breaking of
the water against the rocks, and what with the sun
shining on it and forming a natural Iris, and the
prodigious depth of the gulf below, it is enough to
astonish one that looks on it. Upon the summit of this
rock stands the ruins and some pillars and cornices of
the Temple of Sibylla Tyburtina, or Albunea, a round
fabric, still discovering some of its pristine beauty. Here
was a <a id="tn_png_206"></a><!--TN: "gread" changed to "great"-->great deal of gunpowder drying in the sun, and a
little beneath, mills belonging to the Pope.</p>

<p>And now we returned to Rome. By the way, we were
showed, at some distance, the city Præneste, and the
Hadrian villa, now only a heap of ruins; and so came
late to our lodging.</p>

<p>We now determined to desist from visiting any more
curiosities, except what should happen to come in our
way, when my companion, Mr. Henshaw, or myself should
go to take the air: only I may not omit that one afternoon,
diverting ourselves in the Piazza Navona, a mountebank
there to allure curious strangers, taking off a ring
from his finger, which seemed set with a dull, dark stone
a little swelling out, like what we call (though untruly)
a toadstone, and wetting his finger a little in his mouth,
and then touching it, it emitted a luculent flame as bright<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
and large as a small wax candle; then, blowing it out,
repeated this several times. I have much regretted that
I did not purchase the receipt of him for making that
composition at what price soever; for though there
is a process in Jo. Baptista Porta and others how to do
it, yet on several trials they none of them have succeeded.</p>

<p>Among other observations I made in Rome are these:
as to coins and medals, ten <i>asses</i> make the Roman <i>denarius</i>,
five the <i>quinarius</i>, ten <i>denarii</i> an <i>aureus</i>; which accompt
runs almost exactly with what is now in use of <i>quatrini</i>,
<i>baiocs</i>, <i>julios</i>, and <i>scudi</i>, each exceeding the other in the
proportion of ten. The <i>sestertius</i> was a small silver coin,
marked <span style="font-size:.8em;">H. S.</span> or rather <span style="font-size:.8em;">LL</span><sup>s</sup>, valued two pounds and a
half of silver, viz, 250 <i>denarii</i>, about twenty-five golden
<i>ducati</i>. The stamp of the Roman <i>denarius</i> varied, having
sometimes a Janus bifrons, the head of Roma armed, or
with a chariot and two horses, which were called <i>bigi</i>;
if with four, <i>quadrigi</i>: if with a Victoria, so named.
The mark of the <i>denarius</i> was distinguished &gt; | &lt; thus,
or X; the <i>quinarius</i> of half value, had, on one side, the
head of Rome and V; the reverse, Castor and Pollux on
horseback, inscribed <i>Roma</i>, etc.</p>

<p>I observed that in the Greek church they made the
sign of the cross from the right hand to the left; contrary
to the Latins and the schismatic Greeks; gave the
benediction with the first, second, and little finger
stretched out, retaining the third bent down, expressing
a distance of the third Person of the Holy Trinity from
the first two.</p>

<p>For sculptors and architects, we found Bernini and
Algardi were in the greatest esteem; Fiamingo, as a
statuary; who made the Andrea in St. Peter's, and is
said to have died mad because it was placed in an ill
light. Among the painters, Antonio de la Cornea, who
has such an address of counterfeiting the hands of the
ancient masters so well as to make his copies pass for
originals; Pietro de Cortone, Monsieur Poussin, a Frenchman,
and innumerable more. Fioravanti, for armor,
plate, dead life, tapestry, etc. The chief masters of
music, after Marc Antonio, the best treble, is Cavalier
Lauretto, an eunuch; the next Cardinal Bichi's eunuch,
Bianchi, tenor, and Nicholai, bass. The Jews in Rome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
wore red hats, till the Cardinal of Lyons, being short-sighted,
lately saluted one of them, thinking him to be
a Cardinal as he passed by his coach; on which an order
was made, that they should use only the yellow color.
There was now at Rome one Mrs. Ward, an English devotée,
who much solicited for an order of Jesuitesses.</p>

<p>At executions I saw one, a gentleman, hanged in his
cloak and hat for murder. They struck the malefactor
with a club that first stunned him, and then cut his
throat. At Naples they use a frame, like ours at
Halifax.<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_30_30">30</a></p>

<p>It is reported that Rome has been once no less than
fifty miles in compass, now not thirteen, containing in
it 3,000 churches and chapels, monasteries, etc. It is
divided into fourteen regions or wards; has seven mountains,
and as many campi or valleys; in these are fair
parks, or gardens, called villas, being only places of
recess and pleasure, at some distance from the streets,
yet within the walls.</p>

<p>The bills of exchange I took up from my first entering
Italy till I went from Rome, amounting to but 616 <i>ducati
di banco</i>, though I purchased many books, pictures, and
curiosities.</p>
