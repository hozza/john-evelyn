<p>I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles
from Wotton, to see my son-in-law's new house, the
outside, to the coving, being such excellent brickwork,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
based with Portland stone, with the pilasters, windows,
and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good
and solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's
houses in Surrey, when finished. I returned to
Wotton in the evening, though weary.</p>
