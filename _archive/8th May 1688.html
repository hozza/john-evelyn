<p>His Majesty, alarmed by the great fleet
of the Dutch (while we had a very inconsiderable one),
went down to Chatham; their fleet was well prepared,
and out, before we were in any readiness, or had any
considerable number to have encountered them, had there
been occasion, to the great reproach of the nation; while
being in profound peace, there was a mighty land army,
which there was no need of, and no force at sea, where
only was the apprehension; but the army was doubtless
kept and increased, in order to bring in and countenance
Popery, the King beginning to discover his intention, by
many instances pursued by the Jesuits, against his first
resolution to alter nothing in the Church Establishment,
so that it appeared there can be no reliance on Popish
promises.</p>
