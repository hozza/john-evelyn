<p>I went this day with my wife and
four servants from Sayes Court, removing much furniture
of all sorts, books, pictures, hangings, bedding, etc., to
furnish the apartment my brother assigned me, and now,
after more than forty years, to spend the rest of my days
with him at Wotton, where I was born; leaving my
house at Deptford full furnished, and three servants, to
my son-in-law Draper, to pass the summer in, and
such longer time as he should think fit to make use
of it.</p>
