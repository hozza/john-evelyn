<p>I went to see Dulwich College,
being the pious foundation of one Alleyn, a famous
comedian, in King James's time. The chapel is pretty,
the rest of the hospital very ill contrived; it yet maintains
divers poor of both sexes. It is in a melancholy
part of Camberwell parish. I came back by certain medicinal
Spa waters, at a place called Sydenham Wells, in
Lewisham parish, much frequented in summer.</p>
