<p>I went to the Tower, and visited
the Earl of Danby, the late Lord High Treasurer, who
had been imprisoned four years: he received me with
great kindness. I dined with him, and stayed till night.
We had discourse of many things, his Lady railing
sufficiently at the keeping her husband so long in prison.
Here I saluted the Lord Dumblaine's wife, who before
had been married to Emerton, and about whom there
was that scandalous business before the delegates.</p>
