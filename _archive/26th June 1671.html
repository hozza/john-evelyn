<p>To Council, where Lord Arlington
acquainted us that it was his Majesty's proposal we
should, every one of us, contribute £20 toward building
a Council chamber and conveniences somewhere in Whitehall,
that his Majesty might come and sit among us, and
hear our debates; the money we laid out to be reimbursed
out of the contingent moneys already set apart
for us, viz, £1,000 yearly. To this we unanimously
consented. There came an uncertain bruit from Barbadoes
of some disorder there. On my return home I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
stepped in at the theater to see the new machines for the
intended scenes, which were indeed very costly and magnificent.</p>
