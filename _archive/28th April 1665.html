<p>I went to Tunbridge, to see a solemn
exercise at the free-school there.</p>

<p>Having taken orders with my marshal about my prisoners,
and with the doctor and chirurgeon to attend the
wounded enemies, and of our own men, I went to London
again, and visited my charge, several with legs and
arms off; miserable objects, God knows.</p>
