<p>I went early to Whitehall to hear
Dr. Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, preaching on Eccles.
ix. 18. I returned in the evening, and visited Lady
Tuke, and found with her Sir George Wakeman, the
physician, whom I had seen tried and acquitted, among
the plotters for poisoning the late King, on the accusation
of the famous Oates; and surely I believed him
guiltless.</p>
