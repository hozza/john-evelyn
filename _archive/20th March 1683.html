<p>Dined at Dr. Whistler's, at the
Physicians' College, with Sir Thomas Millington, both
learned men; Dr. W. the most facetious man in nature,
and now Censor of the college. I was here consulted
where they should build their library; it is a pity this college
is built so near Newgate Prison, and in so obscure a hole,
a fault in placing most of our public buildings and
churches in the city, through the avarice of some few
men, and his Majesty not overruling it, when it was in
his power after the dreadful conflagration.</p>
