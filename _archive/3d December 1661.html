<p>By universal suffrage of our philosophic
assembly, an order was made and registered that
I should receive their public thanks for the honorable
mention I made of them by the name of Royal Society,
in my Epistle dedicatory to the Lord Chancellor, before
my Traduction of Naud√¶us. Too great an honor for a
trifle.</p>
