<p>January, 1698-99. My cousin Pierrepoint died. She
was daughter to Sir John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's
nephew; she was widow to William Pierrepoint, brother
to the Marquis of Dorchester, and mother to Evelyn
Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston; a most excellent and prudent
lady.</p>

7,000 men to be a standing army, and no strangers to be

county member, Sir R.Â Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect
him.</p>
