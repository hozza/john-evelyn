<p>2d May, <a id="tn_png_276a"></a><!--TN: Period added after "1687"-->1687. I dined with Mynheer Diskvelts, the
Holland Ambassador, a prudent and worthy person.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
There dined Lord Middleton, principal Secretary of State,
Lord Pembroke, Lord Lumley, Lord Preston, Colonel Fitzpatrick,
and Sir John Chardin. After dinner, the Ambassador
discoursed of and deplored the stupid folly of our
politics, in suffering the French to take Luxemburg, it
being a place of the most concern to have been defended,
for the interest not only of the Netherlands, but of
England.</p>
