Glanville, and his son, to Wotton, to solemnize the

Sir Francis Vincent, Sir Richard Onslow, Mr. Thomas
Howard (son to Sir Robert, and Captain of the King's
Guard), Mr. Hyldiard, Mr. James, Mr. Herbert, nephew

Church, in the burying place of the family. A great
concourse of coaches and people accompanied the solemnity.</p>
