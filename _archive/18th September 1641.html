<p>I went to see that most impregnable
town and fort of Hysdune, where I was exceedingly
obliged to one Colonel Crombe, the lieutenant-governor,
who would needs make me accept the honor of being
captain of the watch, and to give the word this night.
The fortification is very irregular, but esteemed one of
the most considerable for strength and situation in the
Netherlands. We departed toward Gorcum. Here Sir
Kenelm Digby, traveling toward Cologne, met us.</p>

<p>The next morning, the 19th, we arrived at Dort, passing
by the Decoys, where they catch innumerable
quantities of fowl.</p>
