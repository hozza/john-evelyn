<p>I went to Tunbridge Wells, to visit
my Lord Clifford, late Lord Treasurer, who was there
to divert his mind more than his body; it was believed
that he had so engaged himself to the Duke, that rather
than take the Test, without which he was not capable of
holding any office, he would resign that great and honorable
station. This, I am confident, grieved him to the
heart, and at last broke it; for, though he carried with
him music, and people to divert him, and, when I came
to see him, lodged me in his own apartment, and would
not let me go from him, I found he was struggling in
his mind; and being of a rough and ambitious nature,
he could not long brook the necessity he had brought
on himself, of submission to this conjuncture. Besides,
he saw the Dutch war, which was made much by his advice,
as well as the shutting up of the Exchequer, very unprosperous.
These things his high spirit could not support.
Having stayed here two or three days, I obtained
leave of my Lord to return.</p>

<p>In my way, I saw my Lord of Dorset's house at
Knowle, near Sevenoaks, a great old-fashioned house.</p>
