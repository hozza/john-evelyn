<p>While I was at church came a
letter from Mr. Godolphin, that my dear friend his lady
was exceedingly ill, and desiring my prayers and assistance.
My wife and I took boat immediately, and went
to Whitehall, where, to my inexpressible sorrow, I found
she had been attacked with a new fever, then reigning
this excessive hot autumn, and which was so violent,
that it was not thought she could last many hours.</p>
