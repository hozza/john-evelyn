<p>We took boat again, passing by Charmont,
a proud castle on the left hand; before it is a
sweet island, deliciously shaded with tall trees. A little
distance from hence, we went on shore at Amboise, a
very agreeable village, built of stone, and the houses
covered with blue slate, as the towns on the Loire generally
are; but the castle chiefly invited us, the thickness
of whose towers from the river to the top, was admirable.
We entered by the drawbridge, which has an
invention to let one fall, if not premonished. It is full
of halls and spacious chambers, and one staircase is large
enough, and sufficiently commodious, to receive a coach,
and land it on the very tower, as they told us had been
done. There is some artillery in it; but that which is
most observable is in the ancient chapel, viz, a stag's
head, or branches, hung up by chains, consisting of
twenty browantlers, the beam bigger than a man's middle,
and of an incredible length. Indeed, it is monstrous,
and yet I cannot conceive how it should be artificial
they show also the ribs and vertebr√¶ of the same beast;
but these might be made of whalebone.</p>

<p>Leaving the castle, we passed Mont Louis, a village<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
having no houses above ground but such only as are
hewn out of the main rocks of excellent freestone. Here
and there the funnel of a chimney appears on the surface
among the vineyards which are over them, and in
this manner they inhabit the caves, as it were sea-cliffs,
on one side of the river for many miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOURS</div>

<p>We now came within sight of Tours, where we were
designed for the rest of the time I had resolved to stay
in France, the sojournment being so agreeable. Tours
is situate on the east side of a hill on the river Loire,
having a fair bridge of stone called St. Edme; the streets
are very long, straight, spacious, well built, and exceeding
clean; the suburbs large and pleasant, joined to the
city by another bridge. Both the church and monastery
of St. Martin are large, of Gothic building, having four
square towers, fair organs, and a stately altar, where they
show the bones and ashes of St. Martin, with other relics.
The Mall without comparison is the noblest in Europe for
length and shade, having seven rows of the tallest and
goodliest elms I had ever beheld, the innermost of which
do so embrace each other, and at such a height, that
nothing can be more solemn and majestical. Here we
played a party, or party or two, and then walked about
the town walls, built of square stone, filled with earth,
and having a moat. No city in France exceeds it in
beauty, or delight.</p>
