<p>I went with Dr. Godolphin and his
brother Sir William to St. Alban's, to see a library he
would have bought of the widow of Dr. Cartwright,
late Archdeacon of St. Alban's, a very good collection
of books, especially in divinity; he was to give Â£300
for them. Having seen the <span class="small">GREAT CHURCH</span>, now newly
repaired by a public contribution, we returned home.</p>
