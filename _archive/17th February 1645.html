<p>I was invited, after dinner, to
the Academy of the Humorists, kept in a spacious hall
belonging to Signor Mancini, where the wits of the town
meet on certain days to recite poems, and debate on
several subjects. The first that speaks is called the
Lord, and stands in an eminent place, and then the rest
of the Virtuosi recite in order. By these ingenious exercises,
besides the learned discourses, is the purity of
the Italian tongue daily improved. The room is hung
round with devices, or emblems, with mottoes under
them. There are several other Academies of this nature,
bearing like fantastical titles. In this of the Humorists
is the picture of Guarini, the famous author of the Pastor
Fido, once of this society. The chief part of the day
we spent in hearing the academic exercises.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
