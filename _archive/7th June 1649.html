<p>I visited Sir Arthur Hopton<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_38_38">38</a> (brother
to Sir Ralph, Lord Hopton, that noble hero), who having
been Ambassador extraordinary in Spain, sojourned some
time with my father-in-law at Paris, a most excellent person.
Also Signora Lucretia, a Greek lady, whom I knew in
Italy, now come over with her husband, an English
gentleman. Also, the Earl and Countess of Arundel,
taking leave of them and other friends now ready to depart
for France. This night was a scuffle between some
rebel soldiers and gentlemen about the Temple.</p>

<p>June 10th, 1649. Preached the Archbishop of Armagh
in Lincoln's-Inn, from Romans 5, verse 13. I received
the blessed Sacrament, preparatory to my journey.</p>
