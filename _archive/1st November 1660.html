<p>I went with some of my relations
to Court, to show them his Majesty's cabinet and closet
of rarities; the rare miniatures of Peter Oliver, after
Raphael, Titian, and other masters, which I infinitely
esteem; also, that large piece of the Duchess of Lennox,
done in enamel, by Petitot, and a vast number of agates,
onyxes, and intaglios, especially a medallion of Cæsar, as
broad as my hand; likewise, rare cabinets of pietra-commessa,
a landscape of needlework, formerly presented by
the Dutch to King Charles I. Here I saw a vast book of
maps, in a volume near four yards large; a curious ship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
model; and, among the clocks, one that showed the rising
and setting of the sun in the zodiac; the sun represented
by a face and rays of gold, upon an azure sky,
observing the diurnal and annual motion, rising and setting
behind a landscape of hills,—the work of our famous
Fromantil,—and several other rarities.</p>
