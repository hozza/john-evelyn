<p>I dined at Chiffinch's house-warming,
in St. James's Park; he was his Majesty's
closet-keeper, and had his new house full of good pictures,
etc. There dined with us Russell, Popish Bishop
of Cape Verd, who was sent out to negotiate his Majesty's
match with the Infanta of Portugal, after the Ambassador
was returned.</p>
