<p>My daughter, Mary, began to
learn music of Signor Bartholomeo, and dancing of Monsieur
Isaac, reputed the best masters.</p>

<p>Having had several violent fits of an ague, recourse
was had to bathing my legs in milk up to the knees, made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
as hot as I could endure it: and sitting so in it in a deep
churn, or vessel, covered with blankets, and drinking
<i>carduus</i> posset, then going to bed and sweating, I not
only missed that expected fit, but had no more, only
continued weak, that I could not go to church till Ash
Wednesday, which I had not missed, I think, so long in
twenty years, so gracious had God been to me.</p>

<p>After this warning and admonition, I now began to
look over and methodize all my writings, accounts, letters,
papers; inventoried the goods, and other articles of the
house, and put things into the best order I could, and
made my will; that now, growing in years, I might
have none of these secular things and concerns to
distract me, when it should please Almighty God to call
me from this transitory life. With this, I prepared
some special meditations and devotions for the time of
sickness. The Lord Jesus grant them to be salutary for
my poor soul in that day, that I may obtain mercy and
acceptance!</p>
