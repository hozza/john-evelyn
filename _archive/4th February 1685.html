<p>I went to London, hearing his
Majesty had been the Monday before (2d February) surprised
in his bedchamber with an apoplectic fit, so that
if, by God's providence, Dr. King (that excellent chirurgeon
as well as physician) had not been accidentally
present to let him bleed (having his lancet in his pocket),
his Majesty had certainly died that moment; which might
have been of direful consequence, there being nobody else<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
present with the King save this Doctor and one more, as
I am assured. It was a mark of the extraordinary dexterity,
resolution, and presence of mind in the Doctor, to
let him bleed in the very paroxysm, without staying the
coming of other physicians, which regularly should have
been done, and for want of which he must have a regular
pardon, as they tell me. This rescued his Majesty for the
instant, but it was only a short reprieve. He still complained,
and was relapsing, often fainting, with sometimes
epileptic symptoms, till Wednesday, for which he was
cupped, let bleed in both jugulars, and both vomit and
purges, which so relieved him, that on Thursday hopes of
recovery were signified in the public "Gazette," but that
day about noon, the physicians thought him feverish.
This they seemed glad of, as being more easily allayed
and methodically dealt with than his former fits; so as they
prescribed the famous Jesuit's powder; but it made him
worse, and some very able doctors who were present did
not think it a fever, but the effect of his frequent bleeding
and other sharp operations used by them about his
head, so that probably the powder might stop the circulation,
and renew his former fits, which now made him very
weak. Thus he passed Thursday night with great difficulty,
when complaining of a pain in his side, they drew
twelve ounces more of blood from him; this was by six in
the morning on Friday, and it gave him relief, but it did
not continue, for being now in much pain, and struggling
for breath, he lay dozing, and, after some conflicts, the
physicians despairing of him, he gave up the ghost at half
an hour after eleven in the morning, being the sixth of
February, 1685, in the 36th year of his reign, and 54th of
his age.</p>

<p>Prayers were solemnly made in all the churches, especially
in both the Court Chapels, where the chaplains
relieved one another every half quarter of an hour from
the time he began to be in danger till he expired, according
to the form prescribed in the Church offices.
Those who assisted his Majesty's devotions were, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishops of London, Durham,
and Ely, but more especially Dr. Ken, the Bishop
of Bath and Wells.<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_55_55">55</a> It is said they exceedingly urged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the receiving Holy Sacrament, but his Majesty told them
he would consider of it, which he did so long till it was
too late. Others whispered that the Bishops and Lords,
except the Earls of Bath and Feversham, being ordered
to withdraw the night before, Huddleston, the priest,
had presumed to administer the Popish offices. He gave
his breeches and keys to the Duke who was almost continually
kneeling by his bedside, and in tears. He also
recommended to him the care of his natural children, all
except the Duke of Monmouth, now in Holland, and in
his displeasure. He entreated the Queen to pardon him
(not without cause); who a little before had sent a Bishop
to excuse her not more frequently visiting him, in regard
of her excessive grief, and withal that his Majesty would
forgive it if at any time she had offended him. He spoke
to the Duke to be kind to the Duchess of Cleveland,
and especially Portsmouth, and that Nelly might not
starve.</p>

<p>Thus died King Charles II., of a vigorous and robust
constitution, and in all appearance promising a long life.
He was a prince of many virtues, and many great imper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>fections;
debonair, easy of access, not bloody nor cruel;
his countenance fierce, his voice great, proper of person,
every motion became him; a lover of the sea, and skillful
in shipping; not affecting other studies, yet he had a
laboratory, and knew of many empirical medicines, and
the easier mechanical mathematics; he loved planting and
building, and brought in a politer way of living, which
passed to luxury and intolerable expense. He had a
particular talent in telling a story, and facetious passages,
of which he had innumerable; this made some
buffoons and vicious wretches too presumptuous and
familiar, not worthy the favor they abused. He took
delight in having a number of little spaniels follow him
and lie in his bedchamber, where he often suffered the
bitches to puppy and give suck, which rendered it very
offensive, and indeed made the whole court nasty and
stinking. He would doubtless have been an excellent
prince, had he been less addicted to women, who made
him uneasy, and always in want to supply their immeasurable
profusion, to the detriment of many indigent persons
who had signally served both him and his father.
He frequently and easily changed favorites to his great
prejudice.</p>

<p>As to other public transactions, and unhappy miscarriages,
'tis not here I intend to number them; but certainly
never had King more glorious opportunities to
have made himself, his people, and all Europe happy, and
prevented innumerable mischiefs, had not his too easy
nature resigned him to be managed by crafty men, and
some abandoned and profane wretches who corrupted his
otherwise sufficient parts, disciplined as he had been by
many afflictions during his banishment, which gave him
much experience and knowledge of men and things; but
those wicked creatures took him from off all application
becoming so great a King. The history of his reign
will certainly be the most wonderful for the variety of
matter and accidents, above any extant in former ages:
the sad tragical death of his father, his banishment and
hardships, his miraculous restoration, conspiracies against
him, parliaments, wars, plagues, fires, comets, revolutions
abroad happening in his time, with a thousand other particulars.
He was ever kind to me, and very gracious
upon all occasions, and therefore I cannot without ingrati<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>tude
but deplore his loss, which for many respects, as
well as duty, I do with all my soul.</p>

<p>His Majesty being dead, the Duke, now King James
<a id="tn_png_221"></a><!--TN: Period added after "II" on Page 208-->II., went immediately to Council, and before entering
into any business, passionately declaring his sorrow,
told their Lordships, that since the succession had fallen
to him, he would endeavor to follow the example of his
predecessor in his clemency and tenderness to his people;
that, however he had been misrepresented as affecting
arbitrary power, they should find the contrary; for that the
laws of England had made the King as great a monarch
as he could desire; that he would endeavor to maintain
the Government both in Church and State, as by law established,
its principles being so firm for monarchy, and
the members of it showing themselves so good and loyal
subjects;<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_56_56">56</a> and that, as he would never depart from the
just rights and prerogatives of the Crown, so he would
never invade any man's property; but as he had often
adventured his life in defense of the nation, so he would
still proceed, and preserve it in all its lawful rights and
liberties.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p>This being the substance of what he said, the Lords
desired it might be published, as containing matter of
great satisfaction to a jealous people upon this change,
which his Majesty consented to. Then were the Council
sworn, and a Proclamation ordered to be published that
all officers should continue in their stations, that there
might be no failure of public justice, till his further
pleasure should be known. Then the King rose, the
Lords accompanying him to his bedchamber, where, while
he reposed himself, tired indeed as he was with grief and
watching, they returned again into the Council chamber
to take order for the <span class="small">PROCLAIMING</span> his Majesty, which
(after some debate) they consented should be in the very
form his grandfather, King James I., was, after the death
of Queen Elizabeth; as likewise that the Lords, etc.,
should proceed in their coaches through the city for the
more solemnity of it. Upon this was I, and several
other gentlemen waiting in the Privy gallery, admitted
into the Council chamber to be witness of what was resolved
on. Thence with the Lords, Lord Marshal and
Heralds, and other Crown officers being ready, we first
went to Whitehall gate, where the Lords stood on foot
bareheaded, while the Herald proclaimed his Majesty's
title to the Imperial Crown and succession according to
the form, the trumpets and kettledrums having first
sounded three times, which ended with the people's acclamations.
Then a herald called the Lords' coaches
according to rank, myself accompanying the solemnity in
my Lord Cornwallis's coach, first to Temple Bar, where
the Lord Mayor and his brethren met us on horseback,
in all their formalities, and proclaimed the King; hence
to the Exchange in Cornhill, and so we returned in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
order we set forth. Being come to Whitehall, we all
went and kissed the King and Queen's hands. He had
been on the bed, but was now risen and in his undress.
The Queen was in bed in her apartment, but put forth
her hand, seeming to be much afflicted, as I believe she
was, having deported herself so decently upon all occasions
since she came into England, which made her
universally beloved.</p>

<p>Thus concluded this sad and not joyful day.</p>

<p>I can never forget the inexpressible luxury and profaneness,
gaming, and all dissoluteness, and as it were
total forgetfulness of God (it being Sunday evening),
which this day se'nnight I was witness of, the King sitting
and toying with his concubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland,
and Mazarin, etc., a French boy singing love
songs<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_57_57">57</a> in that glorious gallery, while about twenty of
the great courtiers and other dissolute persons were at
Basset round a large table, a bank of at least 2,000 in
gold before them; upon which two gentlemen, who were
with me, made reflections with astonishment. Six days
after, was all in the dust.</p>

<p>It was enjoined that those who put on mourning should
wear it as for a father, in the most solemn manner.</p>
