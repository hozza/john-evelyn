<p>I was invited by a Dominican
Friar, whom we usually heard preach to a number of
Jews, to be godfather to a converted Turk and Jew. The
ceremony was performed in the Church of Santa Maria
sopra la Minerva, near the Capitol. They were clad in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
white; then exorcised at their entering the church with
abundance of ceremonies, and, when led into the choir,
were baptized by a Bishop, <i>in pontificalibus</i>. The Turk
lived afterward in Rome, sold hot waters and would
bring us presents when he met us, kneeling and kissing
the hems of our cloaks; but the Jew was believed to
be a counterfeit. This church, situated on a spacious
rising, was formerly consecrated to Minerva. It was well
built and richly adorned, and the body of St. Catherine
di Sienna lies buried here. The paintings of the chapel
are by Marcello Venuti; the Madonna over the altar is
by Giovanni di Fiesole, called the Angelic Painter, who
was of the Order of these Monks. There are many
charities dealt publicly here, especially at the procession
on the Annunciation, where I saw his Holiness, with all
the Cardinals, Prelates, etc., <i>in pontificalibus</i>; dowries
being given to 300 poor girls all clad in white. The
Pope had his tiara on his head, and was carried on men's
shoulders in an open armchair, blessing the people as
he passed. The statue of Christ, at the Columna, is
esteemed one of the masterpieces of M. Angelo: innumerable
are the paintings by the best artists, and the
organ is accounted one of the sweetest in Rome. Cardinal
Bembo is interred here. We returned by St.
Mark's, a stately church, with an excellent pavement,
and a fine piece by Perugino, of the Two Martyrs. Adjoining
to this is a noble palace built by the famous
Bramante.</p>
