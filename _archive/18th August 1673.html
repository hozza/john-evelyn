<p>My Lord Clifford, being about this
time returned from Tunbridge, and preparing for Devonshire,
I went to take my leave of him at Wallingford
House; he was packing up pictures, most of which were
of hunting wild beasts and vast pieces of bull-baiting,
bear-baiting, etc. I found him in his study, and restored
to him several papers of state, and others of importance,
which he had furnished me with, on engaging me to
write the "History of the Holland War," with other private
letters of his acknowledgments to my Lord Arlington,
who from a private gentleman of a very noble
family, but inconsiderable fortune, had advanced him
from almost nothing. The first thing was his being in
Parliament, then knighted, then made one of the Commissioners
of sick and wounded, on which occasion we
sat long together; then, on the death of Hugh Pollard,
he was made Comptroller of the Household and Privy
Councillor, yet still my brother Commissioner; after the
death of Lord Fitz-Harding, Treasurer of the Household,
he, by letters to Lord Arlington, which that Lord showed
me, begged of his Lordship to obtain it for him as the
very height of his ambition. These were written with
such submissions and professions of his patronage, as I
had never seen any more acknowledging. The Earl of
Southampton then dying, he was made one of the Commissioners
of the Treasury. His Majesty inclining to put
it into one hand, my Lord Clifford, under pretense of
making all his interest for his patron, my Lord Arlington,
cut the grass under his feet, and procured it for
himself, assuring the King that Lord Arlington did not
desire it. Indeed, my Lord Arlington protested to me
that his confidence in Lord Clifford made him so remiss
and his affection to him was so particular, that he was
absolutely minded to devolve it on Lord Clifford, all the
world knowing how he himself affected ease and quiet,
now growing into years, yet little thinking of this <a id="tn_png_104"></a><!--TN: Period added after "go-by"-->go-by.
This was the great ingratitude Lord Clifford showed,
keeping my Lord Arlington in ignorance, continually
assuring him he was pursuing his interest, which was
the Duke's into whose great favor Lord Clifford was
now gotten; but which certainly cost him the loss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of all, namely, his going so irrevocably far in his interest.</p>

<p>For the rest, my Lord Clifford was a valiant, incorrupt
gentleman, ambitious, not covetous; generous, passionate,
a most constant, sincere friend, to me in particular, so as
when he laid down his office, I was at the end of all my
hopes and endeavors. These were not for high matters,
but to obtain what his Majesty was really indebted to my
father-in-law, which was the utmost of my ambition, and
which I had undoubtedly obtained, if this friend had
stood. Sir Thomas Osborn, who succeeded him, though
much more obliged to my father-in-law and his family,
and my long and old acquaintance, being of a more
haughty and far less obliging nature, I could hope for
little; a man of excellent natural parts; but nothing of
generous or grateful.</p>

<p>Taking leave of my Lord Clifford, he wrung me by
the hand, and, looking earnestly on me, bid me God-b'ye,
adding, "Mr. Evelyn, I shall never see thee more." "No!"
said I, "my Lord, what's the meaning of this? I hope
I shall see you often, and as great a person again."
"No, Mr. Evelyn, do not expect it, I will never see this
place, this city, or Court again," or words of this sound.
In this manner, not without almost mutual tears, I parted
from him; nor was it long after, but the news was that he
was dead, and I have heard from some who I believe knew,
he made himself away, after an extraordinary melancholy.
This is not confidently affirmed, but a servant who lived
in the house, and afterward with Sir Robert Clayton,
Lord Mayor, did, as well as others, report it, and when
I hinted some such thing to Mr. Prideaux, one of his
trustees, he was not willing to enter into that discourse.</p>

<p>It was reported with these particulars, that, causing
his servant to leave him unusually one morning, locking
himself in, he strangled himself with his cravat upon the
bed-tester; his servant, not liking the manner of dismissing
him, and looking through the keyhole (as I
remember), and seeing his master hanging, broke in
before he was quite dead, and taking him down, vomiting
a great deal of blood, he was heard to utter these words:
"Well; let men say what they will, there is a God, a
just God above"; after which he spoke no more. This,
if true, is dismal. Really, he was the chief occasion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the Dutch war, and of all that blood which was lost at
Bergen in attacking the Smyrna fleet, and that whole
quarrel.</p>

<p>This leads me to call to mind what my Lord Chancellor
Shaftesbury affirmed, not to me only, but to all my
brethren the Council of Foreign Plantations, when not
long after, this accident being mentioned as we were one
day sitting in Council, his Lordship told us this remarkable
passage: that, being one day discoursing with him
when he was only Sir Thomas Clifford, speaking of men's
advancement to great charges in the nation, "Well," says
he, "my Lord, I shall be one of the greatest men in
England. Don't impute what I say either to fancy, or
vanity; I am certain that I shall be a mighty man; but
it will not last long; I shall not hold it, but die a bloody
death." "What," says my Lord, "your horoscope tells
you so?" "No matter for that, it will be as I tell you."
"Well," says my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury, "if I were
of that opinion, I either would not be a great man, but
decline preferment, or prevent my danger."</p>

<p>This my Lord affirmed in my hearing before several
gentlemen and noblemen sitting in council at Whitehall.
And I the rather am confident of it, remembering what
Sir Edward Walker (Garter King-at-Arms) had likewise
affirmed to me a long time before, even when he was
first made a Lord; that carrying his pedigree to Lord
Clifford on his being created a peer, and, finding him
busy, he bade him go into his study and divert himself
there till he was at leisure to discourse with him about
some things relating to his family; there lay, said Sir
Edward, on his table, his horoscope and nativity calculated,
with some writing under it, where he read that
he should be advanced to the highest degree in the state
that could be conferred upon him, but that he should
not long enjoy it, but should die, or expressions to that
sense; and I think, (but cannot confidently say) a bloody
death. This Sir Edward affirmed both to me and Sir
Richard Browne; nor could I forbear to note this extraordinary
passage in these memoirs.</p>
