<p>Easter day. The Bishop of Rochester
preached before the King; after which his Majesty,
accompanied with three of his natural sons, the Dukes
of Northumberland, Richmond, and St. Alban (sons of
Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Nelly), went up to the altar;
the three boys entering before the King within the rails,
at the right hand, and three bishops on the left: London
(who officiated), Durham, and Rochester, with the subdean,
Dr. Holder. The King, kneeling before the altar,
making his offering, the Bishops first received, and then
his Majesty; after which he retired to a canopied seat on
the right hand. Note, there was perfume burned before
the office began. I had received the Sacrament at Whitehall
early with the Lords and household, the Bishop of
London officiating. Then went to St. Martin's, where
Dr. Tenison preached (recovered from the smallpox);
then went again to Whitehall as above. In the afternoon,
went to St. Martin's again.</p>
