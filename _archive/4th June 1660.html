<p>I received letters of Sir Richard
Browne's landing at Dover, and also letters from the
Queen, which I was to deliver at Whitehall, not as yet
presenting myself to his Majesty, by reason of the infinite
concourse of people. The eagerness of men, women, and
children, to see his Majesty, and kiss his hands, was so
great, that he had scarce leisure to eat for some days,
coming as they did from all parts of the nation; and the
King being as willing to give them that satisfaction,
would have none kept out, but gave free access to all
sorts of people.</p>

<p>Addressing myself to the Duke, I was carried to his
Majesty, when very few noblemen were with him, and
kissed his hands, being very graciously received. I then
returned home, to meet Sir Richard Browne, who came
not till the 8th, after nineteen years exile, during all
which time he kept up in his chapel the Liturgy and
Offices of the Church of England, to his no small honor,
and in a time when it was so low, and as many thought
utterly lost, that in various controversies both with Papists
and Sectaries, our divines used to argue for the
visibility of the Church, from his chapel and congregation.</p>

<p>I was all this week to and fro at court about business.</p>
