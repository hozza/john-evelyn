<p>Returned to Naples, we went to
see the Arsenal, well furnished with galleys and other
vessels. The city is crowded with inhabitants, gentlemen
and merchants. The government is held of the
Pope by an annual tribute of 40,000 ducats and a white
jennet; but the Spaniard trusts more to the power of
those his natural subjects there; Apulia and Calabria
yielding him near four millions of crowns yearly to maintain
it. The country is divided into thirteen Provinces,
twenty Archbishops, and one hundred and seven Bishops;
the estates of the nobility, in default of the male line,
reverting to the King. Besides the Vice-Roy, there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
among the Chief Magistrates a High Constable, Admiral,
Chief Justice, Great Chamberlain, and Chancellor, with a
Secretary; these being prodigiously avaricious, do wonderfully
enrich themselves out of the miserable people's
labor, silks, manna, sugar, oil, wine, rice, sulphur, and
alum; for with all these riches is this delicious country
blest. The manna falls at certain seasons on the adjoining
hills in form of a thick dew. The very winter here
is a summer, ever fruitful, so that in the middle of February
we had melons, cherries, apricots, and many other
sorts of fruit.</p>

<p>The building of the city is for the size the most magnificent
of any in Europe, the streets exceeding large,
well paved, having many vaults and conveyances under
them for the sulliage; which renders them very sweet
and clean, even in the midst of winter. To it belongeth
more than 3,000 churches and monasteries, and these the
best built and adorned of any in Italy. They greatly
affect the Spanish gravity in their habit; delight in good
horses; the streets are full of gallants on horseback, in
coaches and sedans, from hence brought first into England
by Sir Sanders Duncomb. The women are generally
well featured, but excessively libidinous. The country
people so jovial and addicted to music, that the very
husbandmen almost universally play on the guitar, singing
and composing songs in praise of their sweethearts,
and will commonly go to the field with their fiddle; they
are merry, witty, and genial; all which I much attribute
to the excellent quality of the air. They have a deadly
hatred to the French, so that some of our company were
flouted at for wearing red cloaks, as the mode then was.</p>

<p>This I made the <i>non ultra</i> of my travels, sufficiently
sated with rolling up and down, and resolving within
myself to be no longer an <i>individuum vagum</i>, if ever I
got home again; since, from the report of divers experienced
and curious persons, I had been assured there was
little more to be seen in the rest of the civil world,
after Italy, France, Flanders, and the Low Countries,
but plain and prodigious barbarism.</p>

<p>Thus, about the 7th of February,<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27_27">27</a> we set out on our
return to Rome by the same way we came, not daring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
to adventure by sea, as some of our company were inclined
to do, for fear of Turkish pirates hovering on that
coast; nor made we any stay save at Albano, to view the
celebrated place and sepulchre of the famous duelists
who decided the ancient quarrel between their imperious
neighbors with the loss of their lives. These brothers,
the Horatii and Curiatii, lie buried near the highway,
under two ancient pyramids of stone, now somewhat decayed
and overgrown with rubbish. We took the opportunity
of tasting the wine here, which is famous.</p>

<p>Being arrived at Rome on the 13th of February, we
were again invited to Signor Angeloni's study, where with
greater leisure we surveyed the rarities, as his cabinet
and medals especially, esteemed one of the best collections
of them in Europe. He also showed us two antique
lamps, one of them dedicated to Pallas, the other <i>Laribus
Sacru'</i>, as appeared by their inscriptions; some old Roman
rings and keys; the Egyptian Isis, cast in iron; sundry
rare basso-relievos; good pieces of paintings, principally
of Christ of Correggio, with this painter's own face admirably
done by himself; divers of both the Bassanos; a
great number of pieces by Titian, particularly the
Triumphs; an infinity of natural rarities, dried animals,
Indian habits and weapons, shells, etc.; divers very antique
statues of <a id="tn_png_188"></a><!--TN: Colon changed to a semicolon after "brass"-->brass; some lamps of so fine an earth that
they resembled cornelians, for transparency and color;
hinges of Corinthian brass, and one great nail of the
same metal found in the ruins of Nero's golden house.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we ferried over to Transtevere, to the
palace of Gichi, to review the works of Raphael: and,
returning by St. Angelo, we saw the castle as far as was
permitted, and on the other side considered those admirable
pilasters supposed to be of the foundation of
the Pons Sublicius, over which Horatius Cocles passed;
here anchor three or four water mills, invented by Belizarius:
and thence had another sight of the Farnesi's gardens,
and of the terrace where is that admirable painting
of Raphael, being a Cupid playing with a Dolphin,
wrought <i>รก fresco</i>, preserved in shutters of wainscot, as
well it merits, being certainly one of the most wonderful
pieces of work in the world.</p>
