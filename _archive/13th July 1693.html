<p>I saw the Queen's rare cabinets and
collection of china; which was wonderfully rich and plenti<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>ful,
but especially a large cabinet, looking-glass frame
and stands, all of amber, much of it white, with historical
bas-reliefs and statues, with medals carved in
them, esteemed worth Â£4,000, sent by the Duke of Brandenburgh,
whose country, Prussia, abounds with amber,
cast up by the sea; divers other China and Indian cabinets,
screens, and hangings. In her library were many
books in English, French, and Dutch, of all sorts; a cupboard
of gold plate; a cabinet of silver filagree, which I
think was our Queen Mary's, and which, in my opinion,
should have been generously sent to her.</p>
