<p>The Peers and such Commoners
as were members of the Parliament at Oxford, being
the last of Charles II. meeting, desire the Prince of
Orange to take on him the disposal of the public revenue
till a convention of Lords and Commons should meet
in full body, appointed by his circular letters to the
shires and boroughs, 22d of January. I had now quartered
upon me a Lieutenant-Colonel and eight horses.</p>
