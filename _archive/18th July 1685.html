<p>I went to see the muster of the six
Scotch and English regiments whom the Prince of
Orange had lately sent to his Majesty out of Holland
upon this rebellion, but which were now returning,
there having been no occasion for their use. They
were all excellently clad and well disciplined, and were
encamped on Blackheath with their tents: the King and
Queen came to see them exercise, and the manner
of their encampment, which was very neat and magnificent.</p>

<p>By a gross mistake of the Secretary of his Majesty's
Forces, it had been ordered that they should be quartered
in private houses, contrary to an Act of Parliament,
but, on my informing his Majesty timely of it, it was
prevented.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>The two horsemen which my son and myself sent into
the county troops, were now come home, after a month's
being out to our great charge.</p>
