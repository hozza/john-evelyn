<p>Dr. Cudworth preached before the
King at Whitehall, on 2 Timothy iii. 5, reckoning up the
perils of the last times, in which, among other wickedness,
treasons should be one of the greatest, applying it
to the occasion, as committed under a form of reformation
and godliness; concluding that the prophecy did intend
more particularly the present age, as one of the last
times; the sins there enumerated, more abundantly reigning
than ever.</p>
