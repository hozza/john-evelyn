<p>Sir James Hayes, Secretary to
Prince Rupert, dined with me; after dinner I was sent to
Gravesend to dispose of no fewer than 800 sick men.
That night I got to the fleet at the buoy of the "Nore,"
where I spoke with the King and the Duke; and, after
dinner next day, returned to Gravesend.</p>
