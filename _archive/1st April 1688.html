<p>In the morning, the first sermon was
by Dr. Stillingfleet, Dean of St. Paul's (at Whitehall), on
Luke x. 41, 42. The Holy Communion followed, but was
so interrupted by the rude breaking in of multitudes zealous
to hear the second sermon, to be preached by the Bishop
of Bath and Wells, that the latter part of that holy office
could hardly be heard, or the sacred elements be distributed
without great trouble. The Princess being come, he
preached on Mich. vii. 8, 9, 10, describing the calamity of
the Reformed Church of Judah under the Babylonian persecution,
for her sins, and God's delivery of her on her
repentance; that as Judah emerged, so should the now
Reformed Church, whenever insulted and persecuted.
He preached with his accustomed action, zeal, and energy,
so that people flocked from all quarters to hear
him.</p>
