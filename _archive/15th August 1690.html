<p>I was desired to be one of the
bail of the Earl of Clarendon, for his release from the
Tower, with divers noblemen. The Bishop of St. Asaph
expounds his prophecies to me and Mr. Pepys, etc. The
troops from Blackheath march to Portsmouth. That sweet
and hopeful youth, Sir Charles Tuke, died of the wounds
he received in the fight of the Boyne, to the great sorrow
of all his friends, being (I think) the last male of that
family, to which my wife is related. A more virtuous
young gentleman I never knew; he was learned for his
age, having had the advantage of the choicest breeding
abroad, both as to arts and arms; he had traveled much,
but was so unhappy as to fall in the side of his unfortunate
King.</p>

<p>The unseasonable and most tempestuous weather happening,
the naval expedition is hindered, and the extremity
of wet causes the siege of Limerick to be raised,
King William returned to England. Lord Sidney left
Governor of what is conquered in Ireland, which is near
three parts [in four].</p>
