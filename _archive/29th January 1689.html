<p>The votes of the House of Commons
being carried up by Mr. Hampden, their chairman,
to the Lords, I got a station by the Prince's lodgings at
the door of the lobby to the House, and heard much of
the debate, which lasted very long. Lord Derby was
in the chair (for the House was resolved into a grand
committee of the whole House); after all had spoken, it
came to the question, which was carried by three voices
against a Regency, which 51 were for, 54 against; the
minority alleging the danger of dethroning Kings, and
scrupling many passages and expressions in the vote of
the Commons, too long to set down particularly. Some
were for sending to his Majesty with conditions: others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
that the King could do no wrong, and that the maladministration
was chargeable on his ministers. There
were not more than eight or nine bishops, and but two
against the Regency; the archbishop was absent, and
the clergy now began to change their note, both in pulpit
and discourse, on their old passive obedience, so as
people began to talk of the bishops being cast out of
the House. In short, things tended to dissatisfaction on
both sides; add to this, the morose temper of the Prince
of Orange, who showed little countenance to the noblemen
and others, who expected a more gracious and
cheerful reception when they made their court. The
English army also was not so in order, and firm to
his interest, nor so weakened but that it might give
interruption. Ireland was in an ill posture as well as
Scotland. Nothing was yet done toward a settlement.
God of his infinite mercy compose these things, that we
may be at last a Nation and a Church under some fixed
and sober establishment!</p>
