<p>The new King much blamed for
neglecting Ireland, now likely to be ruined by the Lord
Tyrconnel and his Popish party, too strong for the
Protestants. Wonderful uncertainty where King James
was, whether in France or Ireland. The Scots seem as
yet to favor King William, rejecting King James's letter
to them, yet declaring nothing positively. Soldiers in
England discontented. Parliament preparing the coronation
oath. Presbyterians and Dissenters displeased at the
vote for preserving the Protestant religion as established
by law, without mentioning what they were to have as to
indulgence.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury and four other Bishops
refusing to come to Parliament, it was deliberated whether
they should incur <i>Pr√¶munire</i>; but it was thought fit to let
this fall, and be connived at, for fear of the people, to
whom these Prelates were very dear, for the opposition
they had given to Popery.</p>

<p>Court offices distributed among Parliament men. No
considerable fleet as yet sent forth. Things far from
settled as was expected, by reason of the slothful, sickly
temper of the new King, and the Parliament's unmindfulness
of Ireland, which is likely to prove a sad omission.</p>

<p>The Confederates beat the French out of the Palatinate,
which they had most barbarously ruined.</p>
