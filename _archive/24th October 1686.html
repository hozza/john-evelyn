<p>Dr. Warren preached before the
Princess at Whitehall, on 5th Matthew, of the blessedness
of the pure in heart, most elegantly describing the bliss
of the beatifical vision. In the afternoon, Sir George
Wheeler, knight and baronet, preached on the 4th Matt.
upon the necessity of repentance, at St. Margaret's, an
honest and devout discourse, and pretty tolerably performed.
This gentleman coming from his travels out of
Greece, fell in love with the daughter of Sir Thomas
Higgins, his Majesty's resident at Venice, niece to the
Earl of Bath, and married her. When they returned into
England, being honored with knighthood, he would needs
turn preacher, and took orders. He published a learned
and ingenious book of his travels, and is a very worthy
person, a little formal and particular, but exceedingly
devout.</p>
