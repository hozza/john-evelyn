<p>We all went to see Bath, where I
bathed in the cross bath. Among the rest of the idle
diversions of the town, one musician was famous
for acting a changeling, which indeed he personated
strangely.</p>

<p>The <i>facci√°ta</i> of this cathedral is remarkable for its
historical carving. The King's Bath is esteemed the
fairest in Europe. The town is entirely built of stone,
but the streets narrow, uneven and unpleasant. Here,
we trifled and bathed, and intervisited with the company
who frequent the place for health, till the 30th, and then
went to Bristol, a city emulating London, not for its
large extent, but manner of building, shops, bridge,
traffic, exchange, market-place, etc. The governor showed
us the castle, of no great concernment. The city wholly
mercantile, as standing near the famous Severn, commodiously
for Ireland, and the Western world. Here I
first saw the manner of refining sugar and casting it into
loaves, where we had a collection of eggs fried in the
sugar furnace, together with excellent Spanish wine.
But, what appeared most stupendous to me, was the rock
of St. Vincent, a little distance from the town, the precipice
whereof is equal to anything of that nature I have
seen in the most confragose cataracts of the Alps, the
river gliding between them at an extraordinary depth.
Here, we went searching for diamonds, and to the Hot
Wells, at its foot. There is also on the side of this horrid
Alp a very romantic seat: and so we returned to Bath
in the evening, and July 1st to Cadenham.</p>
