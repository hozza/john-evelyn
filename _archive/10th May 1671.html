<p>Dined at Mr. Treasurer's,<a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_26_26">26</a> in company
with Monsieur De Grammont and several French
noblemen, and one Blood, that impudent, bold fellow who
had not long before attempted to steal the imperial crown
itself out of the Tower, pretending only curiosity of seeing
the regalia there, when, stabbing the keeper, though
not mortally, he boldly went away with it through all
the guards, taken only by the accident of his horse falling
down. How he came to be pardoned, and even
received into favor, not only after this, but several other
exploits almost as daring both in Ireland and here, I
could never come to understand. Some believed he
became a spy of several parties, being well with the
sectaries and enthusiasts, and did his Majesty services
that way, which none alive could do so well as he; but
it was certainly the boldest attempt, so the only treason
of this sort that was ever pardoned. This man had
not only a daring but a villanous, unmerciful look, a false
countenance, but very well-spoken and dangerously insinuating.</p>
