<p>I had news from Padua of my
election to be <i>Syndicus Artistarum</i>, which caused me,
after two days idling in a country villa with the Consul
of Venice, to hasten thither, that I might discharge
myself of that honor, because it was not only chargeable,
but would have hindered my progress, and they chose a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Dutch gentleman in my place, which did not well please
my countrymen, who had labored not a little to do me
the greatest honor a stranger is capable of in that
University. Being freed from this impediment, and having
taken leave of Dr. Janicius, a Polonian, who was going
as physician in the Venetian galleys to Candia, I went
again to Venice, and made a collection of several books
and some toys. Three days after, I returned to Padua,
where I studied hard till the arrival of Mr.Â Henshaw,
Bramstone, and some other English gentlemen whom I
had left at Rome, and who made me go back to Venice,
where I spent some time in showing them what I had
seen there.</p>
