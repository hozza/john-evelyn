<p>We arrived late at Rotterdam, where
was their annual mart or fair, so furnished with pictures
(especially landscapes and drolleries, as they call those
clownish representations), that I was amazed. Some of
these I bought and sent into England. The reason of
this store of pictures, and their cheapness, proceeds from
their want of land to employ their stock, so that it is an
ordinary thing to find a common farmer lay out two or
three thousand pounds in this commodity. Their houses
are full of them, and they vend them at their fairs to
very great gains. Here I first saw an elephant, who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
extremely well disciplined and obedient. It was a beast
of a monstrous size, yet as flexible and nimble in the joints,
contrary to the vulgar tradition, as could be imagined
from so prodigious a bulk and strange fabric; but I most
of all admired the dexterity and strength of its proboscis,
on which it was able to support two or three men, and by
which it took and reached whatever was offered to it; its
teeth were but short, being a female, and not old. I was
also shown a pelican, or <i>onocratulas</i> of Pliny, with its
large gullets, in which he kept his reserve of fish; the
plumage was white, legs red, flat, and film-footed, likewise
a cock with four legs, two rumps and vents: also a hen
which had two large spurs growing out of her sides, penetrating
the feathers of her wings.</p>
