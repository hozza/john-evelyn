<p>To London, to see the event of the
lottery which his Majesty had permitted Sir Arthur
Slingsby to set up for one day in the Banqueting House,
at Whitehall; I gaining only a trifle, as well as did the
King, Queen-Consort, and Queen-Mother, for near thirty
lots; which was thought to be contrived very unhandsomely
by the master of it, who was, in truth, a mere
shark.</p>
