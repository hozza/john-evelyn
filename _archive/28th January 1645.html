<p>We dined at Sermonetta, descending
all this morning down a stony mountain, unpleasant,
yet full of olive trees; and, anon, pass a tower built on a
rock, kept by a small guard against the banditti who infest
those parts, daily robbing and killing passengers, as
my Lord Banbury and his company found to their cost
a little before. To this guard we gave some money, and
so were suffered to pass, which was still on the Appian
to the <i>Tres Tabernæ</i> (whither the brethren came from
Rome to meet St. Paul, Acts, c. 28); the ruins whereof
are yet very fair, resembling the remainder of some considerable
edifice, as may be judged by the vast stones
and fairness of the arched work. The country environing
this passage is hilly, but rich; on the right hand
stretches an ample plain, being the <i>Pomptini Campi</i>. We
reposed this night at Piperno, in the posthouse without
the town; and here I was extremely troubled with a sore
hand, which now began to fester, from a mischance at
Rome, upon my base, unlucky, stiff-necked, trotting, car<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>rion
mule; which are the most wretched beasts in the
world. In this town was the poet Virgil's Camilla
born.</p>

<p>The day following, we were fain to hire a strong convoy
of about thirty firelocks, to guard us through the
cork woods (much infested with the banditti) as far as
Fossa Nuova, where was the Forum Appii, and now
stands a church with a great monastery, the place where
Thomas Aquinas both studied and lies buried. Here we
all alighted, and were most courteously received by the
Monks, who showed us many relics of their learned Saint
and at the high altar the print forsooth of the mule's
hoof which he caused to kneel before the Host. The
church is old, built after the Gothic manner; but the
place is very agreeably melancholy. After this, pursuing
the same noble [Appian] way (which we had before left
a little), we found it to stretch from Capua to Rome itself,
and afterward as far as Brundusium. It was built
by that famous Consul, twenty-five feet broad, every
twelve feet something ascending for the ease and firmer
footing of horse and man; both the sides are also a little
raised for those who travel on foot. The whole is paved
with a kind of beach-stone, and, as I said, ever and anon
adorned with some old ruin, sepulchre, or broken statue.
In one of these monuments Pancirollus tells us that, in
the time of Paul III., there was found the body of a
young lady, swimming in a kind of bath of precious oil,
or liquor, fresh and entire as if she had been living,
neither her face discolored, nor her hair disordered; at
her feet burnt a lamp, which suddenly expired at the
opening of the vault; having flamed, as was computed,
now 1,500 years, by the conjecture that she was Tulliola,
the daughter of Cicero, whose body was thus found, and
as the inscription testified. We dined this day at Terracina,
heretofore the famous Anxur, which stands upon
a very eminent promontory, the Circean by name.
While meat was preparing, I went up into the town,
and viewed the fair remainders of Jupiter's Temple, now
converted into a church, adorned with most stately columns;
its architecture has been excellent, as may be deduced
from the goodly cornices, moldings, and huge
white marbles of which it is built. Before the portico
stands a pillar thus inscribed:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p class="centerquot"><a id="tn_png_173"></a><!--TN: Quote added before "Inclyta"-->"<i>Inclyta Gothorum Regis monumenta vetusta</i><br>

<p class="continue">for, it seems, Theodoric drained their marches.</p>

<p>On another more ancient:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Imp. Cæsar Divi Nervæ Filius Nerva Trojanus Aug. Germanicus
Dacicus. Pontif. Max. Trib. Pop. xviii. Imp. vi. Cos. v. p. p.

<p>Meaning doubtless, some part of the Via Appia. Then:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Tit. Upio. Aug. optato Pontano Procuratori et Præfect. Classis.—
Ti. Julius. T. Fab. optatus, <span style="font-size:.8em;">II.</span> vir.</i>"</p>



<p>Here is likewise a Columna Milliaria, with something
engraven on it, but I could not stay to consider it. Coming
down again, I went toward the sea-side to contemplate
that stupendous strange rock and promontory,
cleft by hand, I suppose, for the better passage. Within
this is the Circean Cave, which I went into a good way;
it makes a dreadful noise, by reason of the roaring and
impetuous waves continually assaulting the beach, and
that in an unusual manner. At the top, at an excessive
height, stands an old and very great castle. <span class="sidenote">FONDI</span>We arrived
this night at Fondi, a most dangerous passage for robbing;
and so we passed by Galba's villa, and anon entered
the kingdom of Naples, where, at the gate, this
epigraph saluted us: "<i>Hospes, hìc sunt fines Regni Neopolitani;
si amicus advenis, pacatè omnia invenies, et malis
moribus pulsis, bonas leges</i>." The Via Appia is here a
noble prospect; having before considered how it was carried
through vast mountains of rocks for many miles, by
most stupendous labor: here it is infinitely pleasant,
beset with sepulchres and antiquities, full of sweet shrubs
in the environing hedges. At Fondi, we had oranges
and citrons for nothing, the trees growing in every corner,
charged with fruit.</p>
