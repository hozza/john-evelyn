<p>I visited Mr. Fraser, a learned Scotch
gentleman, whom I had formerly recommended to Lord
Berkeley for the instruction and government of his son,
since dead at sea. He had now been in Holland at the sale
of the learned Heinsius's library, and showed me some
very rare and curious books, and some MSS., which he
had purchased to good value. There were three or four
Herbals in miniature, accurately done, divers Roman
antiquities of Verona, and very many books of Aldus's
impression.</p>
