<p>My eldest sister was married to
Edward Darcy, Esq., who little deserved so excellent a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
person, a woman of so rare virtue. I was not present
at the nuptials; but I was soon afterward sent for into
Surrey, and my father would willingly have weaned me
from my fondness of my too indulgent grandmother, intending
to have placed me at Eton; but, not being so provident
for my own benefit, and unreasonably terrified with
the report of the severe discipline there, I was sent back
to Lewes; which perverseness of mine I have since a
thousand times deplored. This was the first time that
ever my parents had seen all their children together in
prosperity. While I was now trifling at home, I saw London,
where I lay one night only. The next day, I dined
at Beddington, where I was much delighted with the
gardens and curiosities. Thence, we returned to the Lady
Darcy's, at Sutton; thence to Wotton; and, on the 16th
of August following, 1633, back to Lewes.</p>
