<p>She was interred in the southeast
end of the church at Deptford, near her grandmother and
several of my younger children and relations. My desire
was she should have been carried and laid among my own
parents and relations at Wotton, where I desire to be interred
myself, when God shall call me out of this uncertain
transitory life, but some circumstances did not permit
it. Our vicar, Dr. Holden, preached her funeral sermon
on Phil. i. 21. "For to me to live is Christ, and to die
is gain," upon which he made an apposite discourse, as
those who heard it assured me (for grief suffered me not
to be present), concluding with a modest recital of her
many virtues and signal piety, so as to draw both tears
and admiration from the hearers. I was not altogether
unwilling that something of this sort should be spoken, for
the edification and encouragement of other young people.</p>

<p>Divers noble persons honored her funeral, some in person,
others sending their coaches, of which there were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
six or seven with six horses, viz, the Countess of Sunderland,
Earl of Clarendon, Lord Godolphin, Sir Stephen
Fox, Sir William Godolphin, Viscount Falkland, and
others. There were distributed among her friends about
sixty rings.</p>

<p>Thus lived, died, and was buried the joy of my life, and
ornament of her sex and of my poor family! God Almighty
of his infinite mercy grant me the grace thankfully
to resign myself and all I have, or had, to his
divine pleasure, and in his good time, restoring health
and comfort to my family: "teach me so to number my
days, that I may apply my heart to wisdom," be prepared
for my dissolution, and that into the hands of my
blessed Savior I may recommend my spirit! Amen!</p>

<p>On looking into her closet, it is incredible what a number
of collections she had made from historians, poets,
travelers, etc., but, above all, devotions, contemplations,
and resolutions on these contemplations, found under her
hand in a book most methodically disposed; prayers, meditations,
and devotions on particular occasions, with many
pretty letters to her confidants; one to a divine (not
named) to whom she writes that he would be her ghostly
father, and would not despise her for her many errors
and the imperfections of her youth, but beg of God to
give her courage to acquaint him with all her faults, imploring
his assistance and spiritual directions. I well
remember she had often desired me to recommend her
to such a person; but I did not think fit to do it as yet,
seeing her apt to be scrupulous, and knowing the great
innocency and integrity of her life.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how one who had acquired such substantial
and practical knowledge in other ornamental parts
of education, especially music, both vocal and instrumental,
in dancing, paying and receiving visits, and necessary
conversation, could accomplish half of what she has
left; but, as she never affected play or cards, which consume
a world of precious time, so she was in continual
exercise, which yet abated nothing of her most agreeable
conversation. But she was a little miracle while she lived,
and so she died!</p>
