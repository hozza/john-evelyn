<p>I went to the Duke of Norfolk, to desire
him to make cousin Evelyn of Nutfield one of the Deputy-Lieutenants
of Surrey, and entreat him to dismiss my
brother, now unable to serve by reason of age and infirmity.
The Duke granted the one, but would not suffer my
brother to resign his commission, desiring he should keep
the honor of it during his life, though he could not act.
He professed great kindness to our family.</p>
