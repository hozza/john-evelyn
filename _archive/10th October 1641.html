<p>I went by wagon, accompanied with
a jovial commissary, to Dunkirk, the journey being made
all on the sea sands. On our arrival, we first viewed the
court of guards, the works, the townhouse, and the new
church; the latter is very beautiful within; and another,
wherein they showed us an excellent piece of "Our Savior's
Bearing the Cross." The harbor, in two channels,
coming up to the town, was choked with a multitude of
prizes.</p>

<p>From hence, the next day, I marched three English
miles toward the packet boat, being a pretty frigate of
six guns, which embarked us for England about three in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>At our going off, the fort, against which our pinnace
anchored saluted my Lord Marshal with twelve great
guns, which we answered with three. Not having the
wind favorable, we anchored that night before Calais.
About midnight, we weighed; and, at four in the morning,
though not far from Dover, we could not make the
pier till four that afternoon, the wind proving contrary
and driving us westward: but at last we got on shore,
October the 12th.</p>

<p>From Dover, I that night rode post to Canterbury.
Here I visited the cathedral, then in great splendor; those
famous windows being entire, since demolished by the
fanatics. The next morning by Sittingbourne, I came to
Rochester, and thence to Gravesend, where a light-horseman
(as they call it) taking us in, we spent our tide as
far as Greenwich. From hence, after we had a little refreshed
ourselves at the College (for by reason of contagion
then in London we balked the inns), we came to
London, landing at Arundel stairs. Here I took leave of
his Lordship, and retired to my lodgings in the Middle
Temple, being about two in the morning, the 14th of
October.</p>
