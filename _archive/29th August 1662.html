<p>The Council and Fellows of <a id="tn_png_397"></a><!--TN: Extra "the" removed-->the
Royal Society went in a body to Whitehall, to
acknowledge his Majesty's royal grace in granting our
Charter, and vouchsafing to be himself our founder;
when the President made an eloquent speech, to which
his Majesty gave a gracious reply and we all kissed his
hand. Next day we went in like manner with our
address to my Lord Chancellor, who had much promoted
our patent: he received us with extraordinary favor. In
the evening I went to the Queen-Mother's Court, and
had much discourse with her.</p>
