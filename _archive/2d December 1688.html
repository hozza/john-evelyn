<p>Dr. Tenison preached at St. Martin's
on Psalm xxxvi. 5, 6, 7, concerning Providence. I
received the blessed Sacrament. Afterward, visited my
Lord Godolphin, then going with the Marquis of Halifax<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
and Earl of Nottingham as Commissioners to the Prince
of Orange; he told me they had little power. Plymouth
declared for the Prince. Bath, York, Hull, Bristol, and
all the eminent nobility and persons of quality through
England, declare for the Protestant religion and laws, and
go to meet the Prince, who every day sets forth new
Declarations against the Papists. The great favorites at
Court, Priests and Jesuits, fly or abscond. Everything,
till now concealed, flies abroad in public print, and is
cried about the streets. Expectation of the Prince coming
to Oxford. The Prince of Wales and great treasure
sent privily to Portsmouth, the Earl of Dover being Governor.
Address from the Fleet not grateful to his Majesty.
The Papists in offices lay down their commissions,
and fly. Universal consternation among them; it looks
like a revolution.</p>
