<p>I went to Delft and Rotterdam,
and two days after back to the Hague, to bespeak a suit
of horseman's armor, which I caused to be made to fit
me. I now rode out of town to see the monument of the
woman, pretended to have been a countess of Holland,
reported to have had as many children at one birth, as
there are days in the year. The basins were hung up in
which they were baptized, together with a large description
of the matter-of-fact in a frame of carved work, in
the church of Lysdun, a desolate place. As I returned,
I diverted to see one of the Prince's Palaces, called the
Hoff Van Hounsler's Dyck, a very fair cloistered and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
quadrangular building. The gallery is prettily painted
with several huntings, and at one end a gordian knot,
with rustical instruments so artificially represented, as to
deceive an accurate eye to distinguish it from actual relievo.
The ceiling of the staircase is painted with the
"Rape of Ganymede," and other pendant figures, the work
of F. Covenberg, of whose hand I bought an excellent
drollery, which I afterward parted with to my brother
George of Wotton, where it now hangs. To this palace
join a fair garden and park, curiously planted with limes.</p>
