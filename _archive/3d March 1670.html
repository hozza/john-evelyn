<p>Finding my brother [Richard] in
such exceeding torture, and that he now began to fall
into convulsion-fits, I solemnly set the next day apart to
beg of God to mitigate his sufferings, and prosper the
only means which yet remained for his recovery, he being
not only much wasted, but exceedingly and all along
averse from being cut (for the stone); but, when he at
last consented, and it came to the operation, and all
things prepared, his spirit and resolution failed.</p>
