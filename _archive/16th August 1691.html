<p>A sermon by the curate; an honest
discourse, but read without any spirit, or seeming concern;
a great fault in the education of young preachers.
Great thunder and lightning on Thursday, but the rain
and wind very violent. Our fleet come in to lay up the
great ships; nothing done at sea, pretending that we
cannot meet the French.</p>
