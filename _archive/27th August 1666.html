<p>I went to St. Paul's church, where,
with Dr. Wren, Mr. Pratt, Mr. May, Mr. Thomas Chicheley,
Mr. Slingsby, the Bishop of London, the Dean of St. Paul's,
and several expert workmen, we went about to survey the
general decays of that ancient and venerable church, and
to set down in writing the particulars of what was fit to
be done, with the charge thereof, giving our opinion from
article to article. Finding the main building to recede
outward it was the opinion of Chicheley and Mr. Pratt
that it had been so built <i>ab origine</i> for an effect in perspective,
in regard of the height; but I was, with Dr.
Wren, quite of another judgment, and so we entered it;
we plumbed the uprights in several places. When we
came to the steeple, it was deliberated whether it were
not well enough to repair it only on its old foundation,
with reservation to the four pillars; this Mr. Chicheley and
Mr. Pratt were also for, but we totally rejected it, and persisted
that it required a new foundation, not only in regard
of the necessity, but for that the shape of what stood was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
very mean, and we had a mind to build it with a noble
cupola, a form of church-building not as yet known in
England, but of wonderful grace. For this purpose, we
offered to bring in a plan and estimate, which after much
contest, was at last assented to, and that we should nominate
a committee of able workmen to examine the present
foundation. This concluded, we drew all up in writing,
and so went with my Lord Bishop to the Dean's.</p>
