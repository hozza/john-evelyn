<p>A signal day. Monk, perceiving
how infamous and wretched a pack of knaves would have
still usurped the supreme power, and having intelligence
that they intended to take away his commission, repenting
of what he had done to the city, and where he and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
his forces were quartered, marches to Whitehall, dissipates
that nest of robbers, and convenes the old Parliament,
the Rump Parliament (so called as retaining some
few rotten members of the other) being dissolved; and
for joy whereof were many thousands of rumps roasted
publicly in the streets at the bonfires this night, with
ringing of bells, and universal jubilee. This was the first
good omen.</p>

<p>From 17th February to 5th April, I was detained in
bed with a kind of double tertian, the cruel effects of the
spleen and other distempers, in that extremity that my
physicians, Drs. Wetherborn, Needham, and Claude, were
in great doubt of my recovery; but it pleased God to deliver
me out of this affliction, for which I render him
hearty thanks: going to church the 8th, and receiving the
blessed eucharist.</p>

<p>During this sickness came divers of my relations and
friends to visit me, and it retarded my going into the
country longer than I intended; however, I wrote and
printed a letter in defense of his Majesty,<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_62_62">62</a> against a
wicked forged paper, pretended to be sent from Brussels
to defame his Majesty's person and virtues and render
him odious, now when everybody was in hope and expectation
of the General and Parliament recalling him,
and establishing the Government on its ancient and right
basis. The doing this toward the decline of my sickness,
and sitting up long in my bed, had caused a small
relapse, out of which it yet pleased God also to free me,
so as by the 14th I was able to go into the country,
which I did to my sweet and native air at Wotton.</p>
