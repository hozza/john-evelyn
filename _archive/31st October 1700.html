<p>My birthday now completed the 80th
year of my age. I with my soul render thanks to God,
who, of his infinite mercy, not only brought me out of
many troubles, but this year restored me to health, after
an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my
sight, hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable,
which I implore him to continue, with the pardon of my
sins past, and grace to acknowledge by my improvement
of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his pleasure to
protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for
my last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed
Savior, the Lord Jesus, Amen!</p>
