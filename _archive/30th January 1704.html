<p>The fast on the Martyrdom of
King Charles I. was observed with more than usual
solemnity.</p>

<p>May, 1704. Dr. Bathurst, President of Trinity College,
Oxford, now died,<a id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_96_96">96</a> I think the oldest acquaintance now
left me in the world. He was eighty-six years of age,
stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after having been a
person of admirable parts and learning. This is a serious
alarm to me. God grant that I may profit by it!
He built a very handsome chapel to the college, and his
own tomb. He gave a legacy of money, and a third part
of his library, to his nephew, Dr. Bohun, who went hence
to his funeral.</p>
