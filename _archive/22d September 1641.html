<p>I went again to Rotterdam to receive
a pass which I expected from Brussels, securing me
through Brabant and Flanders, designing to go into England
through those countries. The Cardinal Infante,
brother to the King of Spain, was then governor. By this
pass, having obtained another from the Prince of Orange,
upon the 24th of September I departed through Dort; but
met with very bad tempestuous weather, being several
times driven back, and obliged to lie at anchor off Keele,
other vessels lying there waiting better weather. The
25th and 26th we made other essays; but were again
repulsed to the harbor, where lay sixty vessels
waiting to sail. But, on the 27th, we, impatient of the
time and inhospitableness of the place, sailed again with
a contrary and impetuous wind and a terrible sea, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
great jeopardy; for we had much ado to keep ourselves
above water, the billows breaking desperately on our
vessel: we were driven into Williamstadt, a place garrisoned
by the English, where the governor had a fair
house. The works, and especially the counterscarp, are
curiously hedged with quick, and planted with a stately
row of limes on the rampart. The church is of a round
structure, with a cupola, and the town belongs entirely
to the Prince of Orange, as does that of Breda, and some
other places.</p>
