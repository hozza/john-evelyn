<p>Dr. Allestree preached at the Abbey,
after which four Bishops were consecrated, Hereford,
Norwich, ...</p>

<p>This night was suppressed a bloody insurrection of
some <span class="smcap">Fifth-Monarchy enthusiasts</span>. Some of them were
examined at the Council the next day; but could say
nothing to extenuate their madness and unwarrantable
zeal.</p>

<p>I was now chosen (and nominated by his Majesty for
one of the Council), by suffrage of the rest of the members,
a Fellow of the Philosophic Society now meeting
at Gresham College, where was an assembly of divers
learned gentlemen. This being the first meeting since
the King's return; but it had been begun some years
before at Oxford, and was continued with interruption
here in London during the Rebellion.</p>

<p>There was another rising of the fanatics, in which
some were slain.</p>
