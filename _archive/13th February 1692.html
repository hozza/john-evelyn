<p>Mr. Boyle having made me one of
the trustees for his charitable bequests, I went to a meeting
of the Bishop of Lincoln, Sir Rob.... wood, and
serjeant, Rotheram, to settle that clause in the will which
related to charitable uses, and especially the appointing
and electing a minister to preach one sermon the first
Sunday in the month, during the four summer months,
expressly against Atheists, Deists, Libertines, Jews, etc.,
without descending to any other controversy whatever,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
for which Â£50 per annum is to be paid quarterly to the
preacher; and, at the end of three years, to proceed to
a new election of some other able divine, or to continue
the same, as the trustees should judge convenient. We
made choice of one Mr. Bentley, chaplain to the Bishop
of Worcester (Dr. Stillingfleet). The first sermon was
appointed for the first Sunday in March, at St. Martin's;
the second Sunday in April, at Bow Church, and so
alternately.</p>
