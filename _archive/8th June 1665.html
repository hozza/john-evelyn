<p>I went again to his Grace, thence to
the Council, and moved for another privy seal for Â£20,000,
and that I might have the disposal of the Savoy
Hospital for the sick and wounded; all which was granted.
Hence to the Royal Society, to refresh among the philosophers.</p>

<p>Came news of his highness's victory, which indeed
might have been a complete one, and at once ended the
war, had it been pursued, but the cowardice of some, or
treachery, or both, frustrated that. We had, however,
bonfires, bells, and rejoicing in the city. Next day, the
9th, I had instant orders to repair to the Downs, so as I
got to Rochester this evening. Next day I lay at Deal,
where I found all in readiness: but, the fleet being hindered
by contrary winds, I came away on the 12th, and
went to Dover, and returned to Deal; and on the 13th,
hearing the fleet was at Solbay, I went homeward, and
lay at Chatham, and on the 14th, I got home. On the
15th, came the eldest son of the present Secretary of
State to the French King, with much other company, to
dine with me. After dinner, I went with him to London,
to speak to my Lord General for more guards, and gave
his Majesty an account of my journey to the coasts under
my inspection. I also waited on his Royal Highness,
now come triumphant from the fleet, gotten into repair.

the Dutch War."</p>
