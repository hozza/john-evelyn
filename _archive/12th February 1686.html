<p>My great cause was heard by
my Lord Chancellor, who granted me a rehearing. I
had six eminent lawyers, my antagonist three, whereof
one was the smooth-tongued solicitor, whom my Lord
Chancellor reproved in great passion for a very small
occasion. Blessed be God for his great goodness to me
this day!</p>
