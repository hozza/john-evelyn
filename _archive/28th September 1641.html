<p>Failing of an appointment, I was
constrained to return to Dort for a bill of exchange; but
it was the 1st of October ere I could get back. At
Keele, I numbered 141 vessels, who durst not yet venture
out; but, animated by the master of a stout bark,
after a small encounter of weather, we arrived by four
that evening at Steenbergen. In the passage we sailed over
a sea called the Plaats, an exceeding dangerous water, by
reason of two contrary tides which meet there very impetuously.
Here, because of the many shelves, we were
forced to tide it along the Channel; but, ere we could
gain the place, the ebb was so far spent, that we were
compelled to foot it at least two long miles, through a
most pelting shower of rain.</p>
