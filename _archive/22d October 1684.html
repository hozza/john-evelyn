<p>I went with Sir William Godolphin
to see the rhinoceros, or unicorn, being the first that I
suppose was ever brought into England. She belonged
to some East India merchants, and was sold (as I remember)
for above Â£2,000. At the same time, I went to
see a crocodile, brought from some of the West India
Islands, resembling the Egyptian crocodile.</p>
