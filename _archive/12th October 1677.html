<p>With Sir Robert Clayton to Marden,
an estate he had bought lately of my kinsman, Sir
John Evelyn, of Godstone, in Surrey, which from a despicable
farmhouse Sir Robert had erected into a seat
with extraordinary expense. It is in such a solitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
among hills, as, being not above sixteen miles from London,
seems almost incredible, the ways up to it are so
winding and intricate. The gardens are large, and well-walled,
and the husbandry part made very convenient
and perfectly understood. The barns, the stacks of corn,
the stalls for cattle, pigeon house, etc., of most laudable
example. Innumerable are the plantations of trees,
especially walnuts. The orangery and gardens are very
curious. In the house are large and noble rooms. He
and his lady (who is very curious in distillery) entertained
me three or four days very freely. I earnestly
suggested to him the repairing of an old desolate dilapidated
church, standing on the hill above the house,
which I left him in good disposition to do, and endow
it better; there not being above four or five houses in
the parish, besides that of this prodigious rich Scrivener.
This place is exceedingly sharp in the winter, by reason
of the serpentining of the hills: and it wants running
water; but the solitude much pleased me. All the
ground is so full of wild thyme, marjoram, and other
sweet plants, that it cannot be overstocked with bees;
I think he had near forty hives of that industrious insect.</p>
