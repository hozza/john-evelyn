<p>My son was made one of the Commissioners
of the Revenue and Treasury of Ireland, to
which employment he had a mind, far from my wishes.
I visited the Earl of Peterborough, who showed me
the picture of the Prince of Wales, newly brought out of
France, seeming in my opinion very much to resemble
the Queen his mother, and of a most vivacious countenance.</p>

<p>April, 1692. No spring yet appearing. The Queen
Dowager went out of England toward Portugal, as pretended,
against the advice of all her friends.</p>
