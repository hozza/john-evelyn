<p>I dined with Nieuport, the Holland
Ambassador, who received me with extraordinary courtesy.
I found him a judicious, crafty, and wise man. He gave
me excellent cautions as to the danger of the times, and
the circumstances our nation was in. I remember the
observation he made upon the ill success of our former
Parliaments, and their private animosities, and little care
of the public.</p>

<p>Came to visit me the old Marquis of Argyle (since
executed), Lord Lothian, and some other Scotch noblemen,
all strangers to me. Note, the Marquis took the
turtle-doves in the aviary for owls.</p>

<p>The Earl of Southampton (since Treasurer) and Mr.
Spencer, brother to the Earl of Sunderland, came to see
my garden.</p>
