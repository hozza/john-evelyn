<p>To London, in order to Sir Richard
Browne, my father-in-law, resigning his place as Clerk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of the Council to Joseph Williamson, Esq., who was admitted,
and was knighted. This place his Majesty had
promised to give me many years before; but, upon consideration
of the renewal of our lease and other reasons,
I chose to part with it to Sir Joseph, who gave us and
the rest of his brother clerks a handsome supper at his
house; and, after supper, a concert of music.</p>
