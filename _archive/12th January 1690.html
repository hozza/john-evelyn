<p>There was read at St. Ann's
Church an exhortatory letter to the clergy of London
from the Bishop, together with a Brief for relieving the
distressed Protestants, and Vaudois, who fled from the
persecution of the French and Duke of Savoy, to
the Protestant Cantons of Switzerland.</p>

<p>The Parliament was unexpectedly prorogued to 2d of
April to the discontent and surprise of many members who,
being exceedingly averse to the settling of anything, proceeding
with animosities, multiplying exceptions against
those whom they pronounced obnoxious, and producing
as universal a discontent against King William and themselves,
as there was before against King James. The
new King resolved on an expedition into Ireland in person.
About 150 of the members who were of the more
royal party, meeting at a feast at the Apollo Tavern near
St. Dunstan's, sent some of their company to the King,
to assure him of their service; he returned his thanks,
advising them to repair to their several counties and preserve
the peace during his absence, and assuring them
that he would be steady to his resolution of defending
the Laws and Religion established. The great Lord suspected
to have counselled this prorogation, universally
denied it. However, it was believed the chief adviser
was the Marquis of Carmarthen, who now seemed to be
most in favor.</p>
