<p>I accompanied Mr. Pepys to
Portsmouth, whither his Majesty was going the first time
since his coming to the Crown, to see in what state the
fortifications were. We took coach and six horses, late
after dinner, yet got to Bagshot that night. While supper
was making ready I went and made a visit to Mrs.
Graham, some time maid of honor to the Queen Dowager,
now wife to James Graham, Esq., of the privy purse to
the King; her house being a walk in the forest, within a
little quarter of a mile from Bagshot town. Very importunate
she was that I would sup, and abide there that
night; but, being obliged by my companion, I returned to
our inn, after she had shown me her house, which
was very commodious, and well furnished, as she was an
excellent housewife, a prudent and virtuous lady. There
is a park full of red deer about it. Her eldest son was
now sick there of the smallpox, but in a likely way of
recovery, and other of her children run about, and among
the infected, which she said she let them do on purpose
that they might while young pass that fatal disease she
fancied they were to undergo one time or other, and that
this would be the best: the severity of this cruel distemper
so lately in my poor family confirming much of
what she affirmed.</p>
