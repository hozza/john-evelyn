<p>Went with the Countess of Sunderland
to Cranbourne, a lodge and walk of my Lord
Godolphin's in Windsor park. There was one room in
the house spared in the pulling down the old one, because
the late Duchess of York was born in it; the rest was
built and added to it by Sir George Carteret, Treasurer
of the Navy; and since, the whole was purchased by my
Lord Godolphin, who spoke to me to go see it, and advise
what trees were fit to be cut down to improve the dwelling,
being environed with old rotten pollards, which corrupt
the air. It stands on a knoll which though insensibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
rising, gives it a prospect over the Keep of Windsor,
about three miles N.Â E. of it. The ground is clayey and
moist; the water stark naught; the park is pretty; the
house tolerable, and gardens convenient. After dinner,
we came back to London, having two coaches both going
and coming, of six horses apiece, which we changed at
Hounslow.</p>
