<p>One of his Majesty's chaplains
preached; after which, instead of the ancient, grave, and
solemn wind music accompanying the organ, was introduced
a concert of twenty-four violins between every
pause, after the French fantastical light way, better suiting
a tavern, or playhouse, than a church. This was the
first time of change, and now we no more heard the cornet
which gave life to the organ; that instrument quite
left off in which the English were so skillful. I dined at
Mr.Â Povey's, where I talked with Cromer, a great musician.</p>
