<p>I walked to Villa Borghese, a
house and ample garden on Mons Pincius, yet somewhat
without the city walls, circumscribed by another wall full
of small turrets and banqueting-houses; which makes it
appear at a distance like a little town. Within it is an
elysium of delight, having in the centre of it a noble
palace; but the entrance of the garden presents us with
a very glorious fabric, or rather door-case, adorned with
divers excellent marble statues. This garden abounded
with all sorts of delicious fruit and exotic simples, fountains
of sundry inventions, groves, and small rivulets.
There is also adjoining to it a vivarium for ostriches,
peacocks, swans, cranes, etc., and divers strange beasts,
deer, and hares. The grotto is very rare, and represents,
among other devices, artificial rain, and sundry
shapes of vessels, flowers, etc.; which is effected by
changing the heads of the fountains. The groves are of
cypress, laurel, pine, myrtle, and olive. The four sphinxes
are very antique, and worthy observation. To this is a
volary, full of curious birds. The house is square with
turrets, from which the prospect is excellent toward
Rome, and the environing hills, covered as they now are
with snow, which indeed commonly continues even a
great part of the summer, affording sweet refreshment.
Round the house is a baluster of white marble, with frequent
jettos of water, and adorned with a multitude of
statues. The walls of the house are covered with antique
incrustations of history, as that of Curtius, the Rape of
Europa, Leda, etc. The cornices above consist of fruitages
and festoons, between which are niches furnished
with statues, which order is observed to the very roof.
In the lodge, at the entry, are divers good statues of
Consuls, etc., with two pieces of field artillery upon carriages,
(a mode much practiced in Italy before the great
men's houses) which they look on as a piece of state
more than defense. In the first hall within, are the
twelve Roman Emperors, of excellent marble; between
them stand porphyry columns, and other precious stones
of vast height and magnitude, with urns of oriental
alabaster. Tables of pietra-commessa: and here is that
renowned Diana which Pompey worshiped, of eastern
marble: the most incomparable Seneca of touch, bleeding
in an huge vase of porphyry, resembling the drops of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
his blood; the so famous Gladiator, and the Hermaphrodite
upon a quilt of stone. The new piece of Daphne,
and David, of Cavaliero Bernini, is observable for the
pure whiteness of the stone, and the art of the statuary
plainly stupendous. There is a multitude of rare pictures
of infinite value, by the best masters; huge tables of
porphyry, and two exquisitely wrought vases of the
same. In another chamber, are divers sorts of instruments
of music: among other toys that of a satyr, which
so artificially expressed a human voice, with the motion
of eyes and head, that it might easily afright one who
was not prepared for that most extravagant sight. They
showed us also a chair that catches fast any one who
sits down in it, so as not to be able to stir out, by certain
springs concealed in the arms and back thereof,
which at sitting down surprises a man on the sudden,
locking him in by the arms and thighs, after a true
treacherous Italian guise. The perspective is also considerable,
composed by the position of looking-glasses,
which render a strange multiplication of things resembling
divers most richly furnished rooms. Here stands a rare
clock of German work; in a word, nothing but what is
magnificent is to be seen in this Paradise.</p>

<p>The next day, I went to the Vatican, where, in the
morning, I saw the ceremony of Pamfilio, the Pope's
nephew, receiving a Cardinal's hat; this was the first
time I had seen his Holiness <i>in pontificalibus</i>. After the
Cardinals and Princes had met in the consistory, the
ceremony was in the Pope's chapel, where he was at the
altar invested with most pompous rites.</p>
