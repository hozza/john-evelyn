<p>Was the first solemn fast and day
of humiliation to deplore the sins which had so long provoked
God against this afflicted church and people, ordered
by Parliament to be annually celebrated to
expiate the guilt of the execrable murder of the late
King.</p>

<p>This day (Oh, the stupendous and inscrutable judgments
of God!) were the carcasses of those arch-rebels, Cromwell,
Bradshawe (the judge who condemned his Majesty),
and Ireton (son-in-law to the Usurper), dragged out of
their superb tombs in Westminster among the Kings, to
Tyburn, and hanged on the gallows there from nine in
the morning till six at night, and then buried under that
fatal and ignominious monument in a deep pit; thousands
of people who had seen them in all their pride being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
spectators. Look back at October 22, 1658,<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_65_65">65</a> and be
astonished! and fear God and honor the King; but meddle
not with them who are given to change!</p>
