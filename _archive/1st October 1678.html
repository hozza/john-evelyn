<p>The Parliament and the whole Nation
were alarmed about a conspiracy of some eminent
Papists for the destruction of the King and introduction
of Popery, discovered by one Oates and Dr. Tongue,<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_39_39">39</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
<span class="small">WHICH LAST I KNEW, BEING THE TRANSLATOR OF THE</span> "Jesuits'
Morals"; I went to see and converse with him at
Whitehall, with Mr. Oates, one that was lately an apostate
to the church of Rome, and now returned again
with this discovery. He seemed to be a bold man, and,
in my thoughts, furiously indiscreet; but everybody believed
what he said; and it quite changed the genius and
motions of the Parliament, growing now corrupt and interested
with long sitting and court practices; but, with all
this, Popery would not go down. This discovery turned
them all as one man against it, and nothing was done
but to find out the depth of this. Oates was encouraged,
and everything he affirmed taken for gospel; the truth
is, the Roman Catholics were exceedingly bold and busy
everywhere, since the Duke forbore to go any longer to
the chapel.</p>
