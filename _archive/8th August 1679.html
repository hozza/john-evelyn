<p>I went this morning to show my
Lord Chamberlain, his Lady, and the Duchess of Grafton,
the incomparable work of Mr. Gibbon, the carver, whom
I first recommended to his Majesty, his house being
furnished like a cabinet, not only with his own work,
but divers excellent paintings of the best hands. Thence,
to Sir Stephen Fox's, where we spent the day.</p>
