<p>I saw a Masque performed at
Court, by six gentlemen and six ladies, <a id="tn_png_11"></a><!--TN: "suprising" changed to "surprising"-->surprising his
Majesty, it being Candlemas day.</p>

<p>8th February, Ash Wednesday, 1665. I visited our
prisoners at Chelsea College, and to examine how the
marshal and sutlers behaved. These were prisoners taken
in the war; they only complained that their bread was
too fine. I dined at Sir Henry Herbert's, Master of the
Revels.</p>
