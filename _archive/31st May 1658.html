<p>I went to visit my Lady Peterborough,
whose son, Mr.Â Mordaunt, prisoner in the Tower, was
now on his trial, and acquitted but by one voice; but
that holy martyr, Dr. Hewer, was condemned to die
without law, jury, or justice, but by a mock Council of
State, as they called it. A dangerous, treacherous time!</p>
