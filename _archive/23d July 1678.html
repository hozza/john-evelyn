<p>Went to see Mr. Elias Ashmole's
library and curiosities, at Lambeth. He had divers
MSS., but most of them astrological, to which study he
is addicted, though I believe not learned, but very industrious,
as his History of the order of the Garter
proves. He showed me a toad included in amber. The
prospect from a turret is very fine, it being so near
London, and yet not discovering any house about the
country. The famous John Tradescant bequeathed his
Repository to this gentleman, who has given them to
the University of Oxford, and erected a lecture on them,
over the laboratory, in imitation of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>Mr. Godolphin was made master of the robes to the King.</p>
