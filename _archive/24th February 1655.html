<p>I was showed a table clock whose
balance was only a crystal ball, sliding on parallel wires,
without being at all fixed, but rolling from stage to stage
till falling on a spring concealed from sight, it was
thrown up to the utmost channel again, made with an
imperceptible declivity, in this continual vicissitude of
motion prettily entertaining the eye every half minute,
and the next half giving progress to the hand that showed
the hour, and giving notice by a small bell, so as in 120
half minutes, or periods of the bullet's falling on the
ejaculatory spring, the clock part struck. This very extraordinary
piece (richly adorned) had been presented by
some German prince to our late king, and was now in
the possession of the usurper; valued at Â£200.</p>
