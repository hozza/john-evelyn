<p>I again saw Mr. Charlton's collection
of spiders, birds, scorpions, and other serpents,
etc.</p>

<p>1st January, 1691-92. This last week died that pious,
admirable Christian, excellent philosopher, and my worthy
friend, Mr. Boyle, aged about 65,â€”a great loss to all that
knew him, and to the public.</p>
