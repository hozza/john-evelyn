<p>We went to see Prince Ludovisio's
villa, where was formerly the <i>Viridarium</i> of the
poet, Sallust. The house is very magnificent, and the
extent of the ground exceedingly large, considering that
it is in a city; in every quarter of the garden are antique
statues, and walks planted with cypress. To this garden
belongs a house of retirement, built in the figure of a
cross, after a particular ordonnance, especially the staircase.
The whiteness and smoothness of the excellent
pargeting was a thing I much observed, being almost as
even and polished, as if it had been of marble. Above,
is a fair prospect of the city. In one of the chambers
hang two famous pieces of Bassano, the one a Vulcan,
the other a Nativity; there is a German clock full of
rare and extraordinary motions; and, in a little room
below are many precious marbles, columns, urns, vases,
and noble statues of porphyry, oriental alabaster, and
other rare materials. About this fabric is an ample area,
environed with sixteen vast jars of red earth, wherein
the Romans used to preserve their oil, or wine rather,
which they buried, and such as are properly called <i>testæ</i>.
In the Palace I must never forget the famous statue of
the Gladiator, spoken of by Pliny, so much followed by
all the rare artists as the many copies testify, dispersed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
through almost all Europe, both in stone and metal.
There is also a Hercules, a head of porphyry, and one
of Marcus Aurelius. In the villa-house is a man's body
flesh and all, petrified, and even converted to marble, as
it was found in the Alps, and sent by the Emperor to
one of the Popes; it lay in a chest, or coffin, lined with
black velvet, and one of the arms being broken, you may
see the perfect bone from the flesh which remains entire.
The Rape of Proserpine, in marble, is of the purest
white, the work of Bernini. In the cabinet near it are
innumerable small brass figures, and other curiosities.
But what some look upon as exceeding all the rest, is a
very rich bedstead (which sort of gross furniture the
Italians much glory in, as formerly did our grandfathers
in England in their inlaid wooden ones) inlaid with all
sorts of precious stones and antique heads, onyxes,
agates, and cornelians, esteemed to be worth 80 or 90,000
crowns. Here are also divers cabinets and tables of the
Florence work, besides pictures in the gallery, especially
the Apollo—a conceited chair to sleep in with the legs
stretched out, with hooks, and pieces of wood to draw
out longer or shorter.</p>

<p>From this villa, we went to see Signor Angeloni's
study, who very courteously showed us such a collection
of rare medals as is hardly to be paralleled; divers good
pictures, and many outlandish and Indian curiosities, and
things of nature.</p>

<p>From him, we walked to Monte Cavallo, heretofore
called Mons Quirinalis, where we saw those two rare
horses, the work of the rivals Phidias and Praxiteles, as
they were sent to Nero (by Tiridates King) out of Armenia.
They were placed on pedestals of white marble
by Sextus V., by whom I suppose their injuries were
repaired, and are governed by four naked slaves, like
those at the foot of the Capitol. Here runs a most noble
fountain, regarding four of the most stately streets for
building and beauty to be seen in any city of Europe.
Opposite to these statues is the Pope's summer palace,
built by Gregory XIII.; and, in my opinion, it is, for
largeness and the architecture, one of the most conspicuous
in Rome, having a stately portico which leads round
the court under columns, in the centre of which there
runs a beautiful fountain. The chapel is incrusted with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
such precious materials, that nothing can be more rich,
or glorious, nor are the other ornaments and movables
about it at all inferior. The hall is painted by Lanfranci,
and others. The garden, which is called the Belvedere
di Monte Cavallo, in emulation of that of the Vatican,
is most excellent for air and prospect; its exquisite fountains,
close walks, grots, piscinas, or stews for fish, planted
about with venerable cypresses, and refreshed with water-music,
aviaries, and other rarities.</p>
