<p>I went to visit Lord Clarendon at
Swallowfield, where was my Lord Cornbury just arrived
from Denmark, whither he had accompanied the Prince
of Denmark two months before, and now come back.
The miserable tyranny under which that nation lives, he
related to us; the King keeps them under an army of
40,000 men, all Germans, he not daring to trust his own
subjects. Notwithstanding this, the Danes are exceedingly
proud, the country very poor and miserable.</p>
