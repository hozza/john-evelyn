<p>This day, his Majesty, Charles II.
came to London, after a sad and long exile and calamitous
suffering both of the King and Church, being seventeen
years. This was also his birthday, and with a
triumph of above 20,000 horse and foot, brandishing their
swords, and shouting with inexpressible joy; the ways
strewn with flowers, the bells ringing, the streets hung
with tapestry, fountains running with wine; the Mayor,
Aldermen, and all the companies, in their liveries, chains
of gold, and banners; Lords and Nobles, clad in cloth of
silver, gold, and velvet; the windows and balconies, all
set with ladies; trumpets, music, and myriads of people
flocking, even so far as from Rochester, so as they were
seven hours in passing the city, even from two in the
afternoon till nine at night.</p>

<p>I stood in the Strand and beheld it, and blessed God.
And all this was done without one drop of blood shed,
and by that very army which rebelled against him: but it
was the Lord's doing, for such a restoration was never
mentioned in any history, ancient or modern, since the
return of the Jews from their Babylonish captivity; nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
so joyful a day and so bright ever seen in this nation,
this happening when to expect or effect it was past all
human policy.</p>
