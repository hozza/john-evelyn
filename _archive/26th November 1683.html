<p>I went to compliment the Duchess
of Grafton, now lying-in of her first child, a son, which
she called for, that I might see it. She was become more
beautiful, if it were possible, than before, and full of
virtue and sweetness. She discoursed with me of many
particulars, with great prudence and gravity beyond her
years.</p>
