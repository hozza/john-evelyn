<p>Dr. Patrick preached in Covent Garden
Church. I participated of the Blessed Sacrament,
recommending to God the deplorable condition of my
dear brother, who was almost in the last agonies of death.
I watched late with him this night. It pleased God to
deliver him out of this miserable life, toward five o'clock
this Monday morning, to my unspeakable grief. He was
a brother whom I most dearly loved, for his many virtues;
but two years younger than myself, a sober, prudent,
worthy gentleman. He had married a great fortune,
and left one only daughter, and a noble seat at Woodcot,
near Epsom. His body was opened, and a stone taken
out of his bladder, not much bigger than a nutmeg. I
returned home on the 8th, full of sadness, and to bemoan
my loss.</p>
