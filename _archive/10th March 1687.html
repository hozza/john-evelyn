<p>His Majesty sent for the Commissioners
of the Privy Seal this morning into his bedchamber,
and told us that though he had thought fit to dispose
of the Seal into a single hand, yet he would so provide
for us, as it should appear how well he accepted our
faithful and loyal service with many gracious expressions
to this effect; upon which we delivered the Seal
into his hands. It was by all the world both hoped and
expected, that he would have restored it to my Lord
Clarendon; but they were astonished to see it given to
Lord Arundel, of Wardour, a zealous Roman Catholic.
Indeed it was very hard, and looked very unkindly, his
Majesty (as my Lord Clarendon protested to me, on my
going to visit him and long discoursing with him about
the affairs of Ireland) finding not the least failure of
duty in him during his government of that kingdom,
so that his recall plainly appeared to be from the stronger
influence of the Papists, who now got all the preferments.</p>

<p>Most of the great officers, both in the Court and country,
Lords and others, were dismissed, as they would not
promise his Majesty their consent to the repeal of the
test and penal statutes against Popish Recusants. To
this end, most of the Parliament men were spoken to in
his Majesty's closet, and such as refused, if in any place
of office or trust, civil or military, were put out of their
employments. This was a time of great trial; but hardly
one of them assented, which put the Popish interest
much backward. The English clergy everywhere preached
boldly against their superstition and errors, and
were wonderfully followed by the people. Not one considerable
proselyte was made in all this time. The party
were exceedingly put to the worst by the preaching and
writing of the Protestants in many excellent treatises,
evincing the doctrine and discipline of the reformed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
religion, to the manifest disadvantage of their adversaries.
To this did not a little contribute the sermon preached
at Whitehall before the Princess of Denmark and a
great crowd of people, and at least thirty of the greatest
nobility, by Dr. Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, on John
viii. 46 (the Gospel of the day), describing through his
whole discourse the blasphemies, perfidy, wresting of
Scripture, preference of tradition before it, spirit of
persecution, superstition, legends, and fables of the
Scribes and Pharisees, so that all the auditory understood
his meaning of a parallel between them and the
Romish priests, and their new Trent religion. He
exhorted his audience to adhere to the written Word,
and to persevere in the Faith taught in the Church of
England, whose doctrine for Catholic and soundness he
preferred to all the communities and churches of Christians
in the world; concluding with a kind of prophecy,
that whatever it suffered, it should after a short trial
emerge to the confusion of her adversaries and the glory
of God.</p>

<p>I went this evening to see the order of the boys and
children at Christ's Hospital. There were near 800 boys
and girls so decently clad, cleanly lodged, so wholesomely
fed, so admirably taught, some the mathematics, especially
the forty of the late King's foundation, that I was
delighted to see the progress some little youths of
thirteen or fourteen years of age had made. I saw them
at supper, visited their dormitories, and much admired
the order, economy, and excellent government of this
most charitable seminary. Some are taught for the
Universities, others designed for seamen, all for trades
and callings. The girls are instructed in all such work
as becomes their sex and may fit them for good wives,
mistresses, and to be a blessing to their generation.
They sang a psalm before they sat down to supper in
the great Hall, to an organ which played all the time,
with such cheerful harmony, that it seemed to me a
vision of angels. I came from the place with infinite
satisfaction, having never seen a more noble, pious, and
admirable charity. All these consisted of orphans only.<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_63_63">63</a>
The foundation was of that pious Prince King Edward
VI., whose picture (held to be an original of Holbein)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
is in the court where the Governors meet to consult on
the affairs of the Hospital, and his statue in white
marble stands in a niche of the wall below, as you go
to the church, which is a modern, noble, and ample
fabric. This foundation has had, and still has, many
benefactors.</p>
