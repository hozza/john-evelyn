<p>We embarked in a felucca for
Livorno, or Leghorn; but the sea running very high, we
put in at Porto Venere, which we made with peril, between
two narrow horrid rocks, against which the sea
dashed with great velocity; but we were soon delivered
into as great a calm and a most ample harbor, being in
the Golfo di Spetia. From hence, we could see Pliny's
Delphini Promontorium, now called Capo fino. Here stood
that famous city of Luna, whence the port was named
Lunaris, being about two leagues over, more resembling
a lake than a haven, but defended by castles and excessive
high mountains. We landed at Lerici, where, being
Sunday, was a great procession, carrying the Sacrament
about the streets in solemn devotion. After dinner we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
took post-horses, passing through whole groves of olive
trees, the way somewhat rugged and hilly at first, but afterward
pleasant. Thus we passed through the towns of
Sarzana and Massa, and the vast marble quarries of Carrara,
and lodged in an obscure inn, at a place called
Viregio. The next morning we arrived at Pisa, where I
met my old friend, Mr. Thomas Henshaw, who was then
newly come out of Spain, and from whose company I never
parted till more than a year after.</p>

<p>The city of Pisa is as much worth seeing as any in
Italy; it has contended with Rome, Florence, Sardinia,
Sicily, and even Carthage. The palace and church of St.
Stefano (where the order of knighthood called by that
name was instituted) drew first our curiosity, the outside
thereof being altogether of polished marble; within, it is
full of tables relating to this Order; over which hang
divers banners and pendants, with other trophies taken
by them from the Turks, against whom they are particularly
obliged to fight; though a religious order, they are
permitted to marry. At the front of the palace stands a
fountain, and the statue of the great Duke Cosmo. The
Campanile, or Settezonio, built by John Venipont, a German,
consists of several orders of pillars, thirty in a row,
designed to be much higher. It stands alone on the right
side of the cathedral, strangely remarkable for this, that
the beholder would expect it to fall, being built exceedingly
declining, by a rare address of the architect; and
how it is supported from falling I think would puzzle a
good geometrician. The Duomo, or Cathedral, standing
near it, is a superb structure, beautified with six columns
of great antiquity; the gates are of brass, of admirable
workmanship. The cemetery called Campo Santo is made
of divers galley ladings of earth formerly brought from
Jerusalem, said to be of such a nature, as to consume
dead bodies in forty hours. 'Tis cloistered with marble
arches; and here lies buried the learned Philip Decius,
who taught in this University. At one side of this church
stands an ample and well-wrought marble vessel, which
heretofore contained the tribute paid yearly by the city
to Cæsar. It is placed, as I remember, on a pillar of
opal stone, with divers other antique urns. Near this,
and in the same field, is the Baptistery of San Giovanni,
built of pure white marble, and covered with so artificial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
a cupola, that the voice uttered under it seems to break
out of a cloud. The font and pulpit, supported by four
lions, is of inestimable value for the preciousness of the
materials. The place where these buildings stand they
call the <span class="smcap">Area</span>. Hence, we went to the College, to which
joins a gallery so furnished with natural rarities, stones,
minerals, shells, dried animals, skeletons, etc., as is hardly
to be seen in Italy. To this the Physic Garden lies,
where is a noble palm tree, and very fine waterworks.
The river Arno runs through the middle of this stately
city, whence the main street is named Lung 'Arno. It is
so ample that the Duke's galleys, built in the arsenal
here, are easily conveyed to Livorno; over the river is
an arch, the like of which, for its flatness, and serving
for a bridge, is nowhere in Europe. The Duke has a
stately Palace, before which is placed the statue of Ferdinand
the Third; over against it is the Exchange, built
of marble. Since this city came to be under the Dukes
of Tuscany, it has been much depopulated, though there
is hardly in Italy any which exceeds it for stately edifices.
The situation of it is low and flat; but the inhabitants
have spacious gardens, and even fields within the walls.</p>
