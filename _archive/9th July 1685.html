<p>Just as I was coming into the lodgings
at Whitehall, a little before dinner, my Lord of Devonshire
standing very near his Majesty's bedchamber door
in the lobby, came Colonel Culpeper, and in a rude manner
looking at my Lord in the face, asked whether this
was a time and place for excluders to appear; my Lord
at first took little notice of what he said, knowing him
to be a hotheaded fellow, but he reiterating it, my Lord
asked Culpeper whether he meant him; he said yes, he
meant his Lordship. My Lord told him he was no excluder
(as indeed he was not); the other affirming it
again, my Lord told him he lied; on which Culpeper
struck him a box on the ear, which my Lord returned, and
felled him. They were soon parted, Culpeper was seized,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
and his Majesty, who was all the while in his bedchamber,
ordered him to be carried to the Greencloth officer, who
sent him to the Marshalsea, as he deserved. My Lord
Devon had nothing said to him.</p>

<p>I supped this night at Lambeth at my old friend's Mr.
Elias Ashmole's, with my Lady Clarendon, the Bishop of
St. Asaph, and Dr. Tenison, when we were treated at a
great feast.</p>
