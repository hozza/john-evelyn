<p>I went to visit Sir John Chardin,
a French gentleman, who traveled three times by land
into Persia, and had made many curious researches in his
travels, of which he was now setting forth a relation. It
being in England this year one of the severest frosts
that has happened of many years, he told me the cold in
Persia was much greater, the ice of an incredible thickness;
that they had little use of iron in all that country,
it being so moist (though the air admirably clear and
healthy) that oil would not preserve it from rusting, so
that they had neither clocks nor watches; some padlocks
they had for doors and boxes.</p>
