<p>I went to visit some friends in the
Tower, when asking for Lord Clarendon, they by mistake
directed me to the Earl of Torrington, who about
three days before had been sent for from the fleet, and
put into the Tower for cowardice and not fighting the
French fleet, which having beaten a squadron of the Hollanders,
while Torrington did nothing, did now ride masters
of the sea, threatening a descent.</p>
