by hand. We passed by Colonel <a id="tn_png_320a"></a><!--TN: "Pophams" changed to "Popham's"-->Popham's, a noble seat,
park, and river. Thence, to Newbury, a considerable town,
and Donnington, famous for its battle, siege, and castle,
this last had been in the possession of old Geoffrey
Chaucer. Then to Aldermaston, a house of Sir Humphrey
Forster's, built <i>Ã  la moderne</i>. Also, that exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
beautiful seat of my Lord Pembroke, on the ascent of

Esq., uncle to my wife, where we made some stay.
The rest of the week we did nothing but feast and make
good cheer, to welcome my wife.</p>
