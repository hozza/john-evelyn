<p>Ascending the hill, we came to
the Forum Trajanum, where his column stands yet entire,
wrought with admirable basso-relievo recording the
Dacian war, the figures at the upper part appearing of
the same proportion with those below. It is ascended
by 192 steps, enlightened with 44 apertures, or windows,
artificially disposed; in height from the pedestal 140
feet.</p>

<p>It had once the ashes of Trajan and his statue, where
now stands St. Peter's of gilt brass, erected by Pope
Sextus V. The sculpture of this stupendous pillar is
thought to be the work of Apollodorus; but what is very
observable is, the descent to the plinth of the pedestal,
showing how this ancient city lies now buried in her
ruins; this monument being at first set up on a rising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
ground. After dinner, we took the air in Cardinal Bentivoglio's
delicious gardens, now but newly deceased. He
had a fair palace built by several good masters on part
of the ruins of Constantine's Baths; well adorned with
columns and paintings, especially those of Guido Reni.</p>
