<p>We took coach, and went fifteen miles
out of the city to Frascati, formerly Tusculum, a villa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of Cardinal Aldobrandini, built for a country house; but
surpassing, in my opinion, the most delicious places I
ever beheld for its situation, elegance, plentiful water,
groves, ascents, and prospects. Just behind the palace
(which is of excellent architecture) in the centre of the
inclosure, rises a high hill, or mountain, all over clad
with tall wood, and so formed by nature, as if it had
been cut out by art, from the summit whereof falls a
cascade, seeming rather a great river than a stream precipitating
into a large theatre of water, representing an
exact and perfect rainbow, when the sun shines out.
Under this, is made an artificial grot, wherein are curious
rocks, hydraulic organs, and all sorts of singing birds,
moving and chirping by force of the water, with several
other pageants and surprising inventions. In the centre
of one of these rooms, rises a copper ball that continually
dances about three feet above the pavement, by virtue
of a wind conveyed secretly to a hole beneath it;
with many other devices to wet the unwary spectators,
so that one can hardly step without wetting to the skin.
In one of these theaters of water, is an Atlas spouting
up the stream to a very great height; and another monster
makes a terrible roaring with a horn; but, above
all, the representation of a storm is most natural, with
such fury of rain, wind, and thunder, as one would
imagine oneself in some extreme tempest. The garden
has excellent walks and shady groves, abundance of rare
fruit, oranges, lemons, etc., and the goodly prospect of
Rome, above all description, so as I do not wonder that
Cicero and others have celebrated this place with such
encomiums. The Palace is indeed built more like a
cabinet than anything composed of stone and mortar;
it has in the middle a hall furnished with excellent marbles
and rare pictures, especially those of Gioseppino
d'Arpino; the movables are princely and rich. This
was the last piece of architecture finished by Giacomo
della Porta, who built it for Pietro Cardinal Aldobrandini,
in the time of Clement VIII.<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29_29">29</a></p>

<p>We went hence to another house and garden not far
distant, on the side of a hill called Mondragone, finished
by Cardinal Scipio Borghese, an ample and kingly edifice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
It has a very long gallery, and at the end a theatre for
pastimes, spacious courts, rare grots, vineyards, olive-grounds,
groves and solitudes. The air is so fresh and
sweet, as few parts of Italy exceed it; nor is it inferior
to any palace in the city itself for statues, pictures, and
furniture; but, it growing late, we could not take such
particular notice of these things as they deserved.</p>
