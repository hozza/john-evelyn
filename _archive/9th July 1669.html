<p>In the morning was celebrated the
Encænia of the New Theater, so magnificently built by
the munificence of Dr. Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of
Canterbury, in which was spent,£25,000, as Sir Christopher
Wren, the architect (as I remember), told me; and
yet it was never seen by the benefactor, my Lord Archbishop
having told me that he never did or ever would
see it. It is, in truth, a fabric comparable to any of this
kind of former ages, and doubtless exceeding any of the
present, as this University does for colleges, libraries,
schools, students, and order, all the universities in the
world. To the theater is added the famous Sheldonian
printing house. This being at the Act and the first time
of opening the Theater (Acts being formerly kept in St.
Mary's Church, which might be thought indecent, that
being a place set apart for the immediate worship of
God, and was the inducement for building this noble
pile), it was now resolved to keep the present Act in it,
and celebrate its dedication with the greatest splendor and
formality that might be; and, therefore, drew a world of
strangers, and other company, to the University, from all
parts of the nation.</p>

<p>The Vice-Chancellor, Heads of Houses, and Doctors,
being seated in magisterial seats, the Vice-Chancellor's
chair and desk, Proctors, etc., covered with <i>brocatelle</i> (a
kind of brocade) and cloth of gold; the University Registrar
read the founder's grant and gift of it to the University
for their scholastic exercises upon these solemn
occasions. Then followed Dr. South, the University's
orator, in an eloquent speech, which was very long, and
not without some malicious and indecent reflections on
the Royal Society, as underminers of the University;
which was very foolish and untrue, as well as unseason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>able.
But, to let that pass from an ill-natured man, the
rest was in praise of the Archbishop and the ingenious
architect. This ended, after loud music from the corridor
above, where an organ was placed, there followed
divers panegyric speeches, both in prose and verse, interchangeably
pronounced by the young students placed in
the rostrums, in Pindarics, Eclogues, Heroics, etc.,
mingled with excellent music, vocal and instrumental, to
entertain the ladies and the rest of the company. A
speech was then made in praise of academical learning.
This lasted from eleven in the morning till seven at
night, which was concluded with ringing of bells, and
universal joy and feasting.</p>
