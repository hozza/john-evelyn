<p>I was invited to my Lord Arundel's,
of Wardour (now newly released of his six years' confinement
in the Tower on suspicion of the plot called
Oates's Plot), where after dinner the same Mr. Pordage
entertained us with his voice, that excellent and stupendous
artist, Signor John Baptist, playing to it on the
harpsichord. My daughter Mary being with us, she also
sang to the great satisfaction of both the masters, and a
world of people of quality present.</p>

<p>She did so also at my Lord Rochester's the evening
following, where we had the French boy so famed for
his singing, and indeed he had a delicate voice, and had
been well taught. I also heard Mrs. Packer (daughter
to my old friend) sing before his Majesty and the Duke,
privately, that stupendous bass, Gosling, accompanying
her, but hers was so loud as took away much of the
sweetness. Certainly never woman had a stronger or
better ear, could she possibly have governed it. She
would do rarely in a large church among the nuns.</p>
