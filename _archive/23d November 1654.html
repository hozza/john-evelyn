<p>I went to London, to visit my
cousin Fanshawe, and this day I saw one of the rarest
collections of agates, onyxes, and intaglios, that I had
ever seen either at home or abroad, collected by a conceited
old hatmaker in Blackfriars, especially one agate
vase, heretofore the great Earl of Leicester's.</p>
