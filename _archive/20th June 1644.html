<p>We took horse to see certain natural
caves, called Gouttière, near Colombière, where there is
a spring within the bowels of the earth, very deep and
so excessive cold, that the drops meeting with some
lapidescent matter, it converts them into a hard stone,
which hangs about it like icicles, having many others in
the form of comfitures and sugar plums, as we call
them.</p>

<p>Near this, we went under the ground almost two furlongs,
lighted with candles, to see the source and spring
which serves the whole city, by a passage cut through
the main rock of freestone.</p>
