<p>I came to Wotton, the place of my
birth, to my brother, and on the 10th to Hampton Court
where I had the honor to kiss his Majesty's hand, and
give him an account of several things I had in charge,
he being now in the power of those execrable villains
who not long after murdered him. I lay at my
cousin, Sergeant Hatton's at Thames Ditton, whence, on
the 13th, I went to London.</p>
