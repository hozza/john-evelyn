<p>I went early to the Old Bailey Sessions
House, to the famous trial of Sir George Wakeman,
one of the Queen's physicians, and three Benedictine
monks; the first (whom I was well acquainted with, and
take to be a worthy gentleman abhorring such a fact),
for intending to poison the King; the others as accomplices
to carry on the plot, to subvert the government,
and introduce Popery. The bench was crowded with
the judges, Lord Mayor justices, and innumerable spectators.
The chief accusers, Dr. Oates (as he called himself),
and one Bedlow, a man of inferior note. Their testimonies
were not so pregnant, and I fear much of it from
hearsay, but swearing positively to some particulars,
which drew suspicion upon their truth; nor did circumstances
so agree, as to give either the bench or jury so
entire satisfaction as was expected. After, therefore, a
long and tedious trial of nine hours, the jury brought
them in not guilty, to the extraordinary triumph of the
Papists, and without sufficient disadvantage and reflections
on witnesses, especially Oates and Bedlow.</p>

<p>This was a happy day for the lords in the Tower,
who, expecting their trial, had this gone against the prisoners
at the bar, would all have been in the utmost
hazard. For my part, I look on Oates as a vain, insolent
man, puffed up with the favor of the Commons for
having discovered something really true, more especially
as detecting the dangerous intrigue of Coleman, proved
out of his own letters, and of a general design which the
Jesuited party of the Papists ever had and still have, to
ruin the Church of England; but that he was trusted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
with those great secrets he pretended, or had any solid
ground for what he accused divers noblemen of, I have
many reasons to induce my contrary belief. That among
so many commissions as he affirmed to have delivered to
them from P. Oliva<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_40_40">40</a> and the Pope,—he who made no
scruple of opening all other papers, letters, and secrets,
should not only not open any of those pretended commissions,
but not so much as take any copy or witness
of any one of them, is almost miraculous. But the Commons
(some leading persons I mean of them) had so
exalted him that they took all he said for Gospel, and
without more ado ruined all whom he named to be conspirators;
nor did he spare whoever came in his way.
But, indeed, the murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey,
suspected to have been compassed by the Jesuits' party
for his intimacy with Coleman (a busy person whom I
also knew), and the fear they had that he was able to
have discovered things to their prejudice, did so exasperate
not only the Commons, but all the nation, that much
of these sharpnesses against the more honest Roman
Catholics who lived peaceably, is to be imputed to that
horrid fact.</p>

<p>The sessions ended, I dined or rather supped (so late it
was) with the judges in the large room annexed to the
place, and so returned home. Though it was not my
custom or delight to be often present at any capital
trials, we having them commonly so exactly published by
those who take them in short-hand, yet I was inclined to
be at this signal one, that by the ocular view of the carriages
and other circumstances of the managers and
parties concerned, I might inform myself, and regulate
my opinion of a cause that had so alarmed the whole
nation.</p>
