<p>Colonel Spencer, colonel of a regiment
of horse in our county of Kent, sent to me, and
intreated that I would take a commission for a troop of
horse, and that I would nominate my lieutenant and
ensigns; I thanked him for the honor intended me; but
would by no means undertake the trouble.</p>
