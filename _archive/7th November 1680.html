<p>I participated of the blessed
Communion, finishing and confirming my resolutions of
giving myself up more entirely to God, to whom I had now
most solemnly devoted the rest of the poor remainder of
life in this world; the Lord enabling me, who am an unprofitable
servant, a miserable sinner, yet depending on
his infinite goodness and mercy accepting my endeavors.</p>
