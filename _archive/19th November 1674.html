<p>I heard that stupendous violin,
Signor Nicholao (with other rare musicians), whom I never
heard mortal man exceed on that instrument. He had a
stroke so sweet, and made it speak like the voice of a
man, and, when he pleased, like a concert of several
instruments. He did wonders upon a note, and was an
excellent composer. Here was also that rare lutanist, Dr.
Wallgrave; but nothing approached the violin in Nicholao's
hand. He played such ravishing things as astonished us all.</p>
