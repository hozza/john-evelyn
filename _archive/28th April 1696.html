<p>The Venetian Ambassador made a
stately entry with fifty footmen, many on horseback, four
rich coaches, and a numerous train of gallants. More
executions this week of the assassins. Oates dedicated a
most villainous, reviling book against King James, which
he presumed to present to King William, who could not
but abhor it, speaking so infamously and untruly of his
late beloved Queen's own father.</p>
