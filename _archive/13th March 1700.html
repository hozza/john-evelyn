<p>I was at the funeral of my Lady
Temple, who was buried at Islington, brought from Addiscombe,
near Croydon. She left my son-in-law Draper
(her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very nobly
and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with
plate and jewels, to the value in all of about £20,000.
She was a very prudent lady, gave many great legacies,
with £500 to the poor of Islington, where her husband,
Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without issue.</p>
