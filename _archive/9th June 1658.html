<p>I went to see the Earl of Northumberland's
pictures, whereof that of the Venetian Senators
was one of the best of Titian's and another of Andrea
del Sarto, viz, a Madonna, Christ, St. John, and an Old
Woman; a St. Catherine of Da Vinci, with divers portraits
of Vandyck; a Nativity of Georgioni; the last of
our blessed Kings (Charles I.), and the Duke of York,
by Lely, a Rosary by the famous Jesuits of Brussels,
and several more. This was in Suffolk House: the new
front toward the gardens is tolerable, were it not drowned
by a too massy and clumsy pair of stairs of stone,
without any neat invention.</p>
