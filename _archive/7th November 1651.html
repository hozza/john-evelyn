<p>I visited Sir Kenelm Digby, with
whom I had much discourse on chemical matters. I
showed him a particular way of extracting oil of sulphur,
and he gave me a certain powder with which he affirmed
that he had fixed â˜¿ (mercury) before the late King. He
advised me to try and digest a little better, and gave me a
water which he said was only rain water of the autumnal
equinox, exceedingly rectified, very volatile; it had a taste
of a strong vitriolic, and smelt like <i>aqua fortis</i>. He intended
it for a dissolvent of calx of gold; but the truth
is, Sir Kenelm was an arrant mountebank. Came news
of the gallant Earl of Derby's execution by the rebels.</p>
