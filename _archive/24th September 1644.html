<p>By Franchesse, St. Menoux,
thence to Moulins, where we dined. This is the chief
town of the Bourbonnois, on the river Allier, very navigable.
The streets are fair; the castle has a noble prospect,
and has been the seat of the Dukes. Here is a
pretty park and garden. After dinner, came many who
offered knives and scissors to sell; it being a town famous
for these trifles. This Duchy of Bourbon is ordinarily
assigned for the dowry of the Queens of France.</p>

<p>Hence, we took horse for Varennes, an obscure village,
where we lay that night. The next day, we went somewhat
out of the way to see the town of Bourbon l'Archambaut,
from whose ancient and rugged castle is derived
the name of the present Royal Family of France. The
castle stands on a flinty rock, overlooking the town. In
the midst of the streets are some baths of medicinal
waters, some of them excessive hot, but nothing so neatly
walled and adorned as ours in Somersetshire; and indeed
they are chiefly used to drink of, our Queen being then
lodged there for that purpose. After dinner, I went to
see the St. Chapelle, a prime place of devotion, where is
kept one of the thorns of our Savior's crown, and a piece
of the real cross; excellent paintings on glass, and some
few statues of stone and wood, which they show for curiosities.
Hence, we went forward to La Palise, a village
that lodged us that night.</p>
