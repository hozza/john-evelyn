<p>I went to see the collection of
one Trean, a rich merchant, who had some good pictures,
especially a rare perspective of Stenwyck; from thence,
to other virtuosos.</p>

<p>The painter, La Neve has an Andromeda, but I think
it a copy after Vandyke from Titian, for the original is
in France. Webb, at the Exchange, has some rare things
in miniature, of Breughel's, also Putti, in twelve squares,
that were plundered from Sir James Palmer.</p>

<p>At Du Bois, we saw two tables of Putti, that were
gotten, I know not how, out of the Castle of St. Angelo,
by old Petit, thought to be Titian's; he had some good
heads of Palma, and one of Stenwyck. Bellcar showed
us an excellent copy of his Majesty's Sleeping Venus and
the Satyr, with other figures; for now they had plundered,
sold, and dispersed a world of rare paintings of
the King's, and his loyal subjects. After all, Sir William
Ducy showed me some excellent things in miniature, and
in oil of Holbein's; Sir Thomas More's head, and a whole-length
figure of Edward VI., which were certainly his
Majesty's; also a picture of Queen Elizabeth; the Lady
Isabella Thynne; a rare painting of Rothenhamer, being
a Susanna; and a Magdalen, of Quintin, the blacksmith;
also a Henry VIII., of Holbein; and Francis I., rare
indeed, but of whose hand I know not.</p>
