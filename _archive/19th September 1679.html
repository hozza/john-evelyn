<p>My Lord Sunderland, one of
the principal Secretaries of State, invited me to dinner,
where was the King's natural son, the Earl of Plymouth,
the Earl of Shrewsbury, Earl of Essex, Earl of Mulgrave,
Mr. Hyde, and Mr. Godolphin. After dinner I
went to prayers at Eton, and visited Mr. Henry Godolphin,
fellow there, and Dr. Craddock.</p>
