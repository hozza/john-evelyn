<p>My Lord's coach conveyed me
to Bury, and thence baiting at Newmarket, stepping in
at Audley-End to see that house again, I slept at Bishop-Stortford,
and, the next day, home. I was accompanied
in my journey by Major Fairfax, of a younger house
of the Lord Fairfax, a soldier, a traveler, an excellent
musician, a good-natured, well-bred gentleman.</p>
