<p>My worthy brother died at Wotton,
in the 83d year of his age, of perfect memory and
understanding. He was religious, sober, and temperate,
and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as
it were, open house the whole year in the same manner,
or gave more noble or free entertainment to the county
on all occasions, so that his house was never free.
There were sometimes twenty persons more than his
family, and some that stayed there all the summer, to
his no small expense; by this he gained the universal
love of the county. He was born at Wotton, went
from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College,
Oxford, thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of
the best quality did, but without intention to study the
law as a profession. He married the daughter of Colwall,
of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire, by
whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George
her son an infant, who being educated liberally, after
traveling abroad, returned and married one Mrs. Gore,
by whom he had several children, but only three
daughters survived. He was a young man of good
understanding, but, over-indulging his ease and pleasure,
grew so very corpulent, contrary to the constitution of
the rest of his father's relations, that he died. My
brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady,
relict of Sir John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy
and ancient Staffordshire family, by whom he had several
children of both sexes. This lady died, leaving only
two daughters and a son. The younger daughter died
before marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril
Wych, a noble and learned gentleman (son of Sir —— Wych),
who had been Ambassador at Constantinople,
and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland. Before this marriage, her only brother married
the daughter of —— Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable
family, but left a widow without any child living; he
died about 1691, and his wife not many years after,
and my brother resettled the whole estate on me. His
sister, Wych, had a portion of £6,000, to which was
added £300 more; the three other daughters, with what
I added, had about £5,000 each. My brother died on the
5th of October, in a good old age and great reputation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my
father, mother, etc. She buried him with extraordinary
solemnity, rather as a nobleman than as a private
gentleman. There were, as I computed, above 2,000
persons at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county
doing him the last honors. I returned to London, till
my lady should dispose of herself and family.</p>
