<p>All the discourse now was about the
Bishops refusing to read the injunction for the abolition
of the Test, etc. It seems the injunction came so crudely
from the Secretary's office, that it was neither sealed nor
signed in form, nor had any lawyer been consulted, so as
the Bishops who took all imaginable advice, put the
Court to great difficulties how to proceed against them.
Great were the consults, and a proclamation was expected
all this day; but nothing was done. The action of the
Bishops was universally applauded, and reconciled many
adverse parties, Papists only excepted, who were now
exceedingly perplexed, and violent courses were every
moment expected. Report was, that the Protestant
secular Lords and Nobility would abet the Clergy.</p>

<p>The Queen Dowager, hitherto bent on her return into
Portugal, now on the sudden, on allegation of a great
debt owing her by his Majesty disabling her, declares her
resolution to stay.</p>

<p>News arrived of the most prodigious earthquake that
was almost ever heard of, subverting the city of Lima
and country in Peru, with a dreadful inundation following it.</p>
