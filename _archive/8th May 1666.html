<p>To Queensborough, where finding the
Richmond frigate, I sailed to the buoy of the Nore to my
Lord-General and Prince Rupert, where was the Rendezvous
of the most glorious fleet in the world, now prepar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>ing
to meet the Hollander. Went to visit my cousin,
Hales, at a sweetly-watered place at Chilston, near Bockton.
The next morning, to Leeds Castle, once a famous
hold, now hired by me of my Lord Culpeper for a prison.
Here I flowed the dry moat, made a new drawbridge,
brought spring water into the court of the Castle to an
old fountain, and took order for the repairs.</p>
