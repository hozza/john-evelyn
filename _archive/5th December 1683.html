<p>I was this day invited to a wedding
of one Mrs. Castle, to whom I had some obligation,
and it was to her fifth husband, a lieutenant-colonel of
the city. She was the daughter of one Burton, a broom-man,
by his wife, who sold kitchen stuff in Kent Street,
whom God so blessed that the father became a very rich,
and was a very honest man; he was sheriff of Surrey, where
I have sat on the bench with him. Another of his
daughters was married to Sir John Bowles; and this
daughter was a jolly friendly woman. There was at the
wedding the Lord Mayor, the Sheriff, several Aldermen
and persons of quality; above all, Sir George Jeffreys,
newly made Lord Chief Justice of England, with Mr.
Justice Withings, danced with the bride, and were exceedingly
merry. These great men spent the rest of the
afternoon, till eleven at night, in drinking healths, taking
tobacco, and talking much beneath the gravity of judges,
who had but a day or two before condemned Mr. Algernon
Sidney, who was executed the 7th on Tower Hill,
on the single witness of that monster of a man, Lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Howard of Escrick, and some sheets of paper taken in
Mr. Sidney's study, pretended to be written by him, but
not fully proved, nor the time when, but appearing to
have been written before his Majesty's Restoration, and
then pardoned by the Act of Oblivion; so that though
Mr. Sidney was known to be a person obstinately averse
to government by a monarch (the subject of the paper
was in answer to one by Sir E.Â Filmer), yet it was
thought he had very hard measure. There is this yet
observable, that he had been an inveterate enemy to
the last king, and in actual rebellion against him; a
man of great courage, great sense, great parts, which
he showed both at his trial and death; for, when he came
on the scaffold, instead of a speech, he told them only
that he had made his peace with God, that he came not
thither to talk, but to die; put a paper into the sheriff's
hand, and another into a friend's; said one prayer as
short as a grace, laid down his neck, and bid the executioner
do his office.</p>

<p>The Duke of Monmouth, now having his pardon, refuses
to acknowledge there was any treasonable plot; for
which he is banished Whitehall. This is a great disappointment
to some who had prosecuted Trenchard,
Hampden, etc., that for want of a second witness were
come out of the Tower upon their <i>habeas corpus</i>.</p>

<p>The King had now augmented his guards with a new
sort of dragoons, who carried also grenades, and were
habited after the Polish manner, with long peaked caps,
very fierce and fantastical.</p>
