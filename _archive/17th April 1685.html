<p><span class="smcap">Good Friday.</span> Dr. Tenison preached
at the new church at St. James, on 1 Cor. xvi. 22, upon
the infinite love of God to us, which he illustrated in
many instances. The Holy Sacrament followed, at which
I participated. The Lord make me thankful! In the
afternoon, Dr. Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, preached in
Whitehall chapel, the auditory very full of Lords, the
two Archbishops, and many others, now drawn to town
upon occasion of the coronation and ensuing Parliament.
I supped with the Countess of Sunderland and Lord
Godolphin, and returned home.</p>
