<p>I entertained Signor Muccinigo,
the Venetian Ambassador, of one of the noblest families
of the State, this being the day of making his public
entry, setting forth from my house with several gentlemen
of Venice and others in a very glorious train. He
staid with me till the Earl of Anglesea and Sir Charles
Cotterell (master of the ceremonies) came with the King's
barge to carry him to the Tower, where the guns were
fired at his landing; he then entered his Majesty's coach,
followed by many others of the nobility. I accompanied
him to his house, where there was a most noble supper
to all the company, of course. After the extraordinary
compliments to me and my wife, for the civilities he
received at my house, I took leave and returned. He is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
a very accomplished person. He is since Ambassador at
Rome.</p>
