<p>I went to see my Lord of Salisbury's
Palace at Hatfield, where the most considerable
rarity, besides the house (inferior to few then in England
for its architecture), were the garden and vineyard, rarely
well watered and planted. They also showed us the picture
of Secretary Cecil, in Mosaic work, very well done
by some Italian hand.</p>

<p>I must not forget what amazed us exceedingly in the
night before, namely, a shining cloud in the air, in shape
resembling a sword, the point reaching to the north; it
was as bright as the moon, the rest of the sky being
very serene. It began about eleven at night, and vanished
not till above one, being seen by all the south of
England. I made many journeys to and from London.</p>
