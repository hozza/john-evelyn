<p>I went to take leave of the ambassadors
for Spain, which were my Lord Treasurer Cottington
and Sir Edward Hyde; and, as I returned, I visited
Mr.Â Morine's garden, and his other rarities, especially
corals, minerals, stones, and natural curiosities; crabs of
the Red Sea, the body no bigger than a small bird's egg,
but flatter, and the two legs, or claws, a foot in length.
He had abundance of shells, at least 1,000 sorts, which
furnished a cabinet of great price; and had a very curious
collection of scarabees and insects, of which he was
compiling a natural history. He had also the pictures of
his choice flowers and plants in miniature. He told me
there were 10,000 sorts of tulips only. He had <i>taille-douces</i>
out of number; the head of the rhinoceros bird,
which was very extravagant, and one butterfly resembling
a perfect bird.</p>
