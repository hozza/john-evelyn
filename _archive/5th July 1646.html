<p>We took, or rather purchased, a boat,
for it could not be brought back against the stream of the
Rhone. We were two days going to Lyons, passing many
admirable prospects of rocks and cliffs, and near the town
down a very steep declivity of water for a full mile. From
Lyons, we proceeded the next morning, taking horse to
Roanne, and lay that night at Feurs. At Roanne we
indulged ourselves with the best that all France affords,
for here the provisions are choice and plentiful, so as the
supper we had might have satisfied a prince. We lay in
damask beds, and were treated like emperors. The town
is one of the neatest built in all France, on the brink of
the Loire; and here we agreed with an old fisher to row
us as far as Orleans. The first night we came as far as
Nevers, early enough to see the town, the Cathedral (St.
Cyre), the Jesuits' College, and the Castle, a palace of the
Duke's, with the bridge to it nobly built.</p>

<p>The next day we passed by La Charité, a pretty town,
somewhat distant from the river. Here I lost my faithful
spaniel Piccioli, who had followed me from Rome. It
seems he had been taken up by some of the Governor's
pages, or footmen, without recovery; which was a great
displeasure to me, because the cur had many useful
qualities.</p>

<p>The next day we arrived at Orleans, taking our turns
to row, of which I reckon my share came to little less
than twenty leagues. Sometimes, we footed it through
pleasant fields and meadows; sometimes, we shot at fowls,
and other birds; nothing came amiss: sometimes, we
played at cards, while others sung, or were composing
verses; for we had the great poet, Mr. Waller, in our
company, and some other ingenious persons.</p>

<p>At Orleans we abode but one day; the next, leaving
our mad Captain behind us, I arrived at Paris, rejoiced
that, after so many disasters and accidents in a tedious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
peregrination, I was gotten so near home, and here I
resolved to rest myself before I went further.</p>

<p>It was now October, and the only time that in my
whole life that I spent most idly, tempted from my more
profitable recesses; but I soon recovered my better resolutions
and fell to my study, learning the High Dutch
and Spanish tongues, and now and then refreshing my
dancing, and such exercises as I had long omitted, and
which are not in much reputation among the sober Italians.</p>
