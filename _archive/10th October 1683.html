<p>Visited the Duchess of Grafton,
not yet brought to bed, and dining with my Lord Chamberlain
(her father), went with them to see Montague
House, a palace lately built by Lord Montague, who had
married the most beautiful Countess of Northumberland.
It is a stately and ample palace. Signor Verrio's fresco
paintings, especially the funeral pile of Dido, on the
staircase, the labors of Hercules, fight with the Centaurs,
his effeminacy with Dejanira, and Apotheosis or reception<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
among the gods, on the walls and roof of the great room
above,â€”I think exceeds anything he has yet done, both
for design, coloring, and exuberance of invention, comparable
to the greatest of the old masters, or what they
so celebrate at Rome. In the rest of the chamber are
some excellent paintings of Holbein, and other masters.
The garden is large, and in good air, but the fronts of
the house not answerable to the inside. The court at
entry, and wings for offices seem too near the street, and
that so very narrow and meanly built, that the corridor
is not in proportion to the rest, to hide the court from
being overlooked by neighbors; all which might have
been prevented, had they placed the house further into
the ground, of which there was enough to spare. But
on the whole it is a fine palace, built after the French
pavilion-way, by Mr. Hooke, the Curator of the Royal
Society. There were with us my Lady Scroope, the
great wit, and Monsieur Chardine, the celebrated traveler.</p>
