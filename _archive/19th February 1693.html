<p>The Bishop of Lincoln preached
in the afternoon at the Tabernacle near Golden Square,
set up by him. Proposals of a marriage between Mr.
Draper and my daughter Susanna. Hitherto an exceedingly
warm winter, such as has seldom been known, and
portending an unprosperous spring as to the fruits of
the earth; our climate requires more cold and winterly
weather. The dreadful and astonishing earthquake swallowing
up Catania, and other famous and ancient cities,
with more than 100,000 persons in Sicily, on 11th January
last, came now to be reported among us.</p>
