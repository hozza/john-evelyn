<p>I visited the Earl of Dover, who
having made his peace with the King, was now come
home. The relation he gave of the strength of the
French King, and the difficulty of our forcing him to
fight, and any way making impression into France, was
very wide from what we fancied.</p>

<p>8th to 30th November, 1691. An extraordinary dry and
warm season, without frost, and like a new spring; such
as had not been known for many years. Part of the
King's house at Kensington was burned.</p>
