at the Abbey, it being his marriage day, after
twenty-four years. He related to me how he had been
treated by Sir William Temple, foreseeing that he might
be a delegate in the concern of my Lady Ogle now
likely come in controversy upon her marriage with Mr.
Thynn; also how earnestly the late Earl of Danby, Lord
Treasurer, sought his friendship, and what plain and
sincere advice he gave him from time to time about his
miscarriages and partialities; particularly his outing Sir
John Duncomb from being Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and Sir Stephen Fox, above all, from being Paymaster
of the Army. The Treasurer's excuse and reason was,
that Fox's credit was so over great with the bankers and
monied men, that he could procure none but by his
means, "for that reason," replied the Bishop, "I would
have made him my friend, Sir Stephen being a person both
honest and of credit." He told him likewise of his stateliness
and difficulty of access, and several other miscarriages,
and which indeed made him hated.</p>
