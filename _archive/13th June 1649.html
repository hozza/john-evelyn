<p>I dined with my worthy friend, Sir
John Owen, newly freed from sentence of death among
the lords that suffered. With him was one Carew, who
played incomparably on the Welsh harp; afterward I
treated divers ladies of my relations, in Spring Garden.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>This night was buried with great pomp, Dorislaus, slain
at the Hague, the villain who managed the trial against
his sacred Majesty.</p>
