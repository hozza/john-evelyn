<p>I was desired by Sir Stephen Fox
and Sir Christopher Wren to accompany them to Lambeth,
with the plot and design of the college to be built
at Chelsea, to have the <a id="tn_png_181"></a><!--TN: "Archibishop s" changed to "Archibishop's"-->Archbishop's approbation. It was
a quadrangle of 200 feet square, after the dimensions of
the larger quadrangle at Christ church, Oxford, for the
accommodation of 440 persons, with governor and officers.
This was agreed on.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of York were just now come
to London, after his escape and shipwreck, as he went by
sea for Scotland.</p>
