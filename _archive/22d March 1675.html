<p>Supped at Sir William Petty's, with
the Bishop of Salisbury, and divers honorable persons.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
We had a noble entertainment in a house gloriously
furnished; the master and mistress of it were extraordinary
persons. Sir William was the son of a mean
man somewhere in Sussex, and sent from school to Oxford,
where he studied Philosophy, but was most eminent
in Mathematics and Mechanics; proceeded Doctor of
Physic, and was grown famous, as for his learning so
for his recovering a poor wench that had been hanged
for felony; and her body having been begged (as the
custom is) for the anatomy lecture, he bled her, put
her to bed to a warm woman, and, with spirits and
other means, restored her to life. The young scholars
joined and made a little portion, and married her to a
man who had several children by her, she living fifteen
years after, as I have been assured. Sir William came
from Oxford to be tutor to a neighbor of mine; thence,
when the rebels were dividing their conquests in Ireland,
he was employed by them to measure and set out the
land, which he did on an easy contract, so much per
acre. This he effected so exactly, that it not only
furnished him with a great sum of money; but enabled
him to purchase an estate worth £4,000 a year. He
afterward married the daughter of Sir Hardress Waller;
she was an extraordinary wit as well as beauty, and a
prudent woman.</p>

<p>Sir William, among other inventions, was author of
the double-bottomed ship, which perished, and he was
censured for rashness, being lost in the Bay of Biscay
in a storm, when, I think, fifteen other vessels miscarried.
This vessel was flat-bottomed, of exceeding use to
put into shallow ports, and ride over small depths of
water. It consisted of two distinct keels cramped together
with huge timbers, etc., so as that a violent stream ran
between; it bore a monstrous broad sail, and he still
persists that it is practicable, and of exceeding use; and
he has often told me he would adventure himself in such
another, could he procure sailors, and his Majesty's permission
to make a second Experiment; which name the
King gave the vessel at the launching.</p>

<p>The Map of Ireland made by Sir William Petty is believed
to be the most exact that ever yet was made of
any country. He did promise to publish it; and I am
told it has cost him near £1,000 to have it engraved at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Amsterdam. There is not a better Latin poet living, when
he gives himself that diversion; nor is his excellence less
in Council and prudent matters of state; but he is so
exceedingly nice in sifting and examining all possible
contingencies, that he adventures at nothing which is
not demonstration. There was not in the whole world
his equal for a superintendent of manufacture and improvement
of trade, or to govern a plantation. If I were
a Prince, I should make him my second Counsellor, at
least. There is nothing difficult to him. He is, besides,
courageous; on which account, I cannot but note a true
story of him, that when Sir Aleyn Brodrick sent him a
challenge upon a difference between them in Ireland,
Sir William, though exceedingly purblind, accepted the
challenge, and it being his part to propound the weapon,
desired his antagonist to meet him with a hatchet, or
axe, in a dark cellar; which the other, of course, refused.</p>

<p>Sir William was, with all this, facetious and of easy
conversation, friendly and courteous, and had such a
faculty of imitating others, that he would take a text
and preach, now like a grave orthodox divine, then falling
into the Presbyterian way, then to the fanatical, the
Quaker, the monk and friar, the Popish priest, with such
admirable action, and alteration of voice and tone, as it
was not possible to abstain from wonder, and one would
swear to hear several persons, or forbear to think he
was not in good earnest an enthusiast and almost beside
himself; then, he would fall out of it into a serious discourse;
but it was very rarely he would be prevailed on
to oblige the company with this faculty, and that only
among most intimate friends. My Lord Duke of Ormond
once obtained it of him, and was almost ravished with
admiration; but by and by, he fell upon a serious reprimand
of the faults and miscarriages of some Princes and
Governors, which, though he named none, did so sensibly
touch the Duke, who was then Lieutenant of Ireland,
that he began to be very uneasy, and wished the spirit
laid which he had raised, for he was neither able to
endure such truths, nor could he but be delighted. At
last, he melted his discourse to a ridiculous subject, and
came down from the joint stool on which he had stood; but
my lord would not have him preach any more. He never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
could get favor at Court, because he outwitted all the
projectors that came near him. Having never known
such another genius, I cannot but mention these particulars,
among a multitude of others which I could produce.
When I, who knew him in mean circumstances, have
been in his splendid palace, he would himself be in
admiration how he arrived at it; nor was it his value or
inclination for splendid furniture and the curiosities
of the age, but his elegant lady could endure nothing
mean, or that was not magnificent. He was very negligent
himself, and rather so of his person, and of a philosophic
temper. "What a to-do is here!" would he say,
"I can lie in straw with as much satisfaction."</p>

<p>He is author of the ingenious deductions from the
bills of mortality, which go under the name of Mr.
Graunt; also of that useful discourse of the manufacture
of wool, and several others in the register of the Royal
Society. He was also author of that paraphrase on the
104th Psalm in Latin verse, which goes about in MS.,
and is inimitable. In a word, there is nothing impenetrable
to him.</p>
