<p>There was sent me by a neighbor a
servant maid, who, in the last month, as she was sitting
before her mistress at work, felt a stroke on her arm a
little above the wrist for some height, the smart of
which, as if struck by another hand, caused her to hold
her arm awhile till somewhat mitigated; but it put her
into a kind of convulsion, or rather hysteric fit. A
gentleman coming casually in, looking on her arm, found
that part powdered with red crosses, set in most exact
and wonderful order, neither swelled nor depressed,
about this shape,</p>

<p style="text-indent:0em;">not seeming to be any way made by artifice, of a reddish
color, not so red as blood, the skin over them smooth,
the rest of the arm livid and of a mortified hue, with
certain prints, as it were, of the stroke of fingers. This
had happened three several times in July, at about ten
days' interval, the crosses beginning to wear out, but
the successive ones set in other different, yet uniform
order. The maid seemed very modest, and came from
London to Deptford with her mistress, to avoid the discourse
and importunity of curious people. She made no
gain by it, pretended no religious fancies; but seemed
to be a plain, ordinary, silent, working wench, somewhat
fat, short, and high-colored. She told me divers
divines and physicians had seen her, but were unsatisfied;
that she had taken some remedies against her fits, but
they did her no good; she had never before had any
fits; once since, she seemed in her sleep to hear one say
to her that she should tamper no more with them, nor
trouble herself with anything that happened, but put her
trust in the merits of Christ only.</p>

<p>This is the substance of what she told me, and what I
saw and curiously examined. I was formerly acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
with the impostorious nuns of Loudun, in France, which
made such noise among the Papists; I therefore thought
this worth the notice. I remember Monsieur Monconys<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19_19">19</a>
(that curious traveler and a Roman Catholic) was by no
means satisfied with the <i>stigmata</i> of those nuns, because
they were so shy of letting him scrape the letters, which
were Jesus, Maria, Joseph (as I think), observing they
began to scale off with it, whereas this poor wench was
willing to submit to any trial; so that I profess I know not
what to think of it, nor dare I pronounce it anything
supernatural.</p>
