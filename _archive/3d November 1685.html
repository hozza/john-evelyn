<p>The French persecution of the
Protestants raging with the utmost barbarity, exceeded
even what the very heathens used: innumerable persons
of the greatest birth and riches leaving all their earthly
substance, and hardly escaping with their lives, dispersed
through all the countries of Europe. The French tyrant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
abrogated the Edict of Nantes which had been made in
favor of them, and without any cause; on a sudden
demolishing all their churches, banishing, imprisoning,
and sending to the galleys all the ministers; plundering
the common people, and exposing them to all sorts of
barbarous usage by soldiers sent to ruin and prey on
them; taking away their children; forcing people to the
Mass, and then executing them as relapsers; they burnt
their libraries, pillaged their goods, ate up their fields
and substance, banished or sent the people to the galleys,
and seized on their estates. There had now been numbered
to pass through Geneva only (and that by stealth,
for all the usual passages were strictly guarded by sea
and land) 40,000 toward Switzerland. In Holland, Denmark,
and all about Germany, were dispersed some hundred
thousands; besides those in England, where, though
multitudes of all degree sought for shelter and welcome
as distressed Christians and confessors, they found least
encouragement, by a fatality of the times we were fallen
into, and the uncharitable indifference of such as should
have embraced them; and I prey it be not laid to our
charge. The famous Claude fled to Holland; Allix and
several more came to London, and persons of great
estates came over, who had forsaken all. France was
almost dispeopled, the bankers so broken, that the tyrant's
revenue was exceedingly diminished, manufactures
ceased, and everybody there, save the Jesuits, abhorred
what was done, nor did the Papists themselves approve
it. What the further intention is, time will show; but
doubtless portending some revolution.</p>

<p>I was shown the harangue which the Bishop of Valentia
on Rhone made in the name of the Clergy, celebrating
the French King, as if he was a God, for
persecuting the poor Protestants, with this expression in
it, "That as his victory over heresy was greater than all
the conquests of Alexander and CÃ¦sar, it was but what
was wished in England; and that God seemed to raise
the French King to this power and magnanimous action,
that he might be in capacity to assist in doing the same
here." This paragraph is very bold and remarkable;
several reflecting on Archbishop Usher's prophecy as now
begun in France, and approaching the orthodox in all
other reformed churches. One thing was much taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
notice of, that the "Gazettes" which were still constantly
printed twice a week, informing us what was done all
over Europe, never spoke of this wonderful proceeding
in France; nor was any relation of it published by any,
save what private letters and the persecuted fugitives
brought. Whence this silence, I list not to conjecture;
but it appeared very extraordinary in a Protestant country
that we should know nothing of what Protestants
suffered, while great collections were made for them in
foreign places, more hospitable and Christian to appearance.</p>
