<p>I went with my noble friend,
Sir William Ducy (afterward Lord Downe), to Thistleworth,
where we dined with Sir Clepesby Crew, and
afterward to see the rare miniatures of Peter Oliver, and
rounds of plaster, and then the curious flowers of Mr.
Barill's garden, who has some good medals and pictures.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Sir Clepesby has fine Indian hangings, and a very good
chimney-piece of water colors, by Breughel, which I
bought for him.</p>
