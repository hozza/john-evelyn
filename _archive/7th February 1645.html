<p>The next day, being Saturday,
we went four miles out of town on mules, to see that
famous volcano, Mount Vesuvius. Here we pass a fair
fountain, called Labulla, which continually boils, supposed
to proceed from Vesuvius, and thence over a river and
bridge, where on a large upright stone, is engraven a
notable inscription relative to the memorable eruption
in 1630.</p>

<p>Approaching the hill, as we were able with our mules,
we alighted, crawling up the rest of the proclivity with
great difficulty, now with our feet, now with our hands,
not without many untoward slips which did much bruise
us on the various colored cinders, with which the whole
mountain is covered, some like pitch, others full of perfect
brimstone, others metallic, interspersed with innumerable
pumices (of all which I made a collection), we at
the last gained the summit of an extensive altitude.
Turning our faces toward Naples, it presents one of the
goodliest prospects in the world; all the Baiæ, Cuma,
Elysian Fields, Capreæ, Ischia, Prochyta, Misenus, Puteoli,
that goodly city, with a great portion of the Tyrrhene
Sea, offering themselves to your view at once, and at so
agreeable a distance, as nothing can be more delightful.
The mountain consists of a double top, the one pointed
very sharp, and commonly appearing above any clouds,
the other blunt. Here, as we approached, we met many
large gaping clefts and chasms, out of which issued such
sulphurous blasts and smoke, that we dared not stand
long near them. Having gained the very summit, I laid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
myself down to look over into that most frightful and
terrible vorago, a stupendous pit of near three miles in
circuit, and half a mile in depth, by a perpendicular
hollow cliff (like that from the highest part of Dover
Castle), with now and then a craggy prominency jetting
out. The area at the bottom is plane, like an even floor,
which seems to be made by the wind circling the ashes
by its eddy blasts. In the middle and centre is a hill,
shaped like a great brown loaf, appearing to consist of
sulphurous matter, continually vomiting a foggy exhalation,
and ejecting huge stones with an impetuous noise
and roaring, like the report of many muskets discharging.
This horrid barathrum engaged our attention for
some hours, both for the strangeness of the spectacle,
and the mention which the old histories make of it, as
one of the most stupendous curiosities in nature, and
which made the learned and inquisitive Pliny adventure
his life to detect the causes, and to lose it in too desperate
an approach. It is likewise famous for the stratagem
of the rebel, Spartacus, who did so much mischief to the
State lurking among and protected by, these horrid
caverns, when it was more accessible and less dangerous
than it is now; but especially notorious it is for the last
conflagration, when, in <i>anno</i> 1630, it burst out beyond
what it had ever done in the memory of history; throwing
out huge stones and fiery pumices in such quantity,
as not only environed the whole mountain, but totally
buried and overwhelmed divers towns and their inhabitants,
scattering the ashes more than a hundred miles,
and utterly devastating all those vineyards, where formerly
grew the most incomparable Greco; when, bursting
through the bowels of the earth, it absorbed the very
sea, and, with its whirling waters, drew in divers galleys
and other vessels to their destruction, as is faithfully
recorded. We descended with more ease than we climbed
up, through a deep valley of pure ashes, which at the
late eruption was a flowing river of melted and burning
brimstone, and so came to our mules at the foot of the
mountain.</p>

<p>On Sunday, we with our guide visited the so much celebrated
Baia, and natural rarities of the places adjacent.
Here we entered the mountain Pausilypus, at the left
hand of which they showed us Virgil's sepulchre erected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
on a steep rock, in form of a small rotunda or cupolated
column, but almost overgrown with bushes and wild bay
trees. At the entrance is this inscription:</p>


<p class="centerquot"><i>Stanisi Cencovius.<br>
1589<br>
Qui <a id="tn_png_180"></a><!--TN: "cinceres" changed to "cineres"-->cineres? Tumuli hæc vestigia, conditur olim<br>
Ille hôc qui cecinit Pascua, Rura Duces.<br>
Can Ree MDLIII.</i><a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_26_26">26</a></p>

<p>After we were advanced into this noble and altogether
wonderful crypt, consisting of a passage spacious enough
for two coaches to go abreast, cut through a rocky mountain
near three quarters of a mile (by the ancient Cimmerii
as reported, but as others say by L. Cocceius, who
employed a hundred thousand men on it), we came to
the midway, where there is a well bored through the
diameter of this vast mountain, which admits the light
into a pretty chapel, hewn out of the natural rock, wherein
hang divers lamps, perpetually burning. The way is
paved under foot; but it does not hinder the dust, which
rises so excessively in this much-frequented passage, that
we were forced at midday to use a torch. At length,
we were delivered from the bowels of the earth into one
of the most delicious plains in the world: the oranges,
lemons, pomegranates, and other fruits, blushing yet on
the perpetually green trees; for the summer is here
eternal, caused by the natural and adventitious heat of
the earth, warmed through the subterranean fires, as was
shown us by our guide, who alighted, and, cutting up a
turf with his knife, and delivering it to me, it was so hot,
I was hardly able to hold it in my hands. This mountain
is exceedingly fruitful in vines, and exotics grow
readily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAGO D'AGNANO</div>

<p>We now came to a lake of about two miles in circumference,
environed with hills; the water of it is fresh and
sweet on the surface, but salt at bottom; some mineral
salt conjectured to be the cause, and it is reported of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
profunditude in the middle that it is bottomless. The
people call it Lago d'Agnano, from the multitude of
serpents which, involved together about the spring, fall
down from the cliffy hills into it. It has no fish, nor will
any live in it. We tried the old experiment on a dog in
the Grotto del Cane, or Charon's Cave; it is not above
three or four paces deep, and about the height of a man,
nor very broad. Whatever having life enters it, presently
expires. Of this we made trial with two dogs, one of
which we bound to a short pole to guide him the more
directly into the further part of the den, where he was no
sooner entered, but—without the least noise, or so much
as a struggle, except that he panted for breath, lolling out
his tongue, his eyes being fixed:—we drew him out dead
to all appearance; but immediately plunging him into the
adjoining lake, within less than half an hour he recovered,
and swimming to shore, ran away from us. We tried the
same on another dog, without the application of the
water, and left him quite dead. The experiment has been
made on men, as on that poor creature whom Peter of
Toledo caused to go in; likewise on some Turkish slaves;
two soldiers, and other foolhardy persons, who all perished,
and could never be recovered by the water of the
lake, as are dogs; for which many learned reasons have
been offered, as Simon Majolus in his book of the Canicular-days
has mentioned, colloq. 15. And certainly the
most likely is, the effect of those hot and dry vapors
which ascend out of the earth, and are condensed by the
ambient cold, as appears by their converting into crystalline
drops on the top, while at the bottom it is so
excessively hot, that a torch being extinguished near it,
and lifted a little distance, was suddenly re-lighted.</p>

<p>Near to this cave are the natural stoves of St. Germain,
of the nature of sudatories, in certain chambers partitioned
with stone for the sick to sweat in, the vapors
here being exceedingly hot, and of admirable success in
the gout, and other cold distempers of the nerves. Hence,
we climed up a hill, the very highway in several places
even smoking with heat like a furnace. The mountains
were by the Greeks called Leucogæi, and the fields
Phlegræn. Hercules here vanquished the Giants, assisted
with lightning. We now came to the Court of Vulcan,
consisting of a valley near a quarter of a mile in breadth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the margin environed with steep cliffs, out of whose
sides and foot break forth fire and smoke in abundance,
making a noise like a tempest of water, and sometimes
discharging in loud reports, like so many guns. The
heat of this place is wonderful, the earth itself being
almost unsufferable, and which the subterranean fires
have made so hollow, by having wasted the matter for
so many years, that it sounds like a drum to those who
walk upon it; and the water thus struggling with those
fires bubbles and spouts aloft into the air. The mouths
of these spiracles are bestrewed with variously colored
cinders, which rise with the vapor, as do many colored
stones, according to the quality of the combustible matter,
insomuch as it is no little adventure to approach
them. They are, however, daily frequented both by sick
and well; the former receiving the fumes, have been
recovered of diseases esteemed incurable. Here we found
a great deal of sulphur made, which they refine in certain
houses near the place, casting it into canes, to a very
great value. Near this we were showed a hill of alum,
where is one of the best mineries, yielding a considerable
revenue. Some flowers of brass are found here; but I
could not but smile at those who persuade themselves
that here are the gates of purgatory (for which it may
be they have erected, very near it, a convent, and named
it St. Januarius), reporting to have often heard screeches
and horrible lamentations proceeding from these caverns
and volcanoes; with other legends of birds that are never
seen, save on Sundays, which cast themselves into the
lake at night, appearing no more all the week after.</p>

<p>We now approached the ruins of a very stately temple,
or theater, of 172 feet in length, and about 80 in
breadth, thrown down by an earthquake, not long since;
it was consecrated to Vulcan, and under the ground are
many strange meanders; from which it is named the
<span class="smcap">Labyrinth</span>; this place is so haunted with bats, that their
perpetual fluttering endangered the putting out our links.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POZZOLO</div>

<p>Hence, we passed again those boiling and smoking hills,
till we came to Pozzolo, formerly the famous Puteoli, the
landing-place of St. Paul, when he came into Italy, after
the tempest described in the Acts of the Apostles. Here
we made a good dinner, and bought divers medals, antiquities,
and other curiosities, of the country people, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
daily find such things among the very old ruins of those
places. This town was formerly a Greek colony, built by
the Samians, a seasonable commodious port, and full of
observable antiquities. We saw the ruins of Neptune's
Temple, to whom this place was sacred, and near it the
stately palace and gardens of Peter de Toledo, formerly
mentioned. Afterward, we visited that admirably built
Temple of Augustus, seeming to have been hewn out of
an entire rock, though indeed consisting of several square
stones. The inscription remains thus: "<i>L. Calphurnius
L. F. Templum Augusto cum ornamentis D. D.</i>;" and under
it, "<i>L. Coccejus L. C. Postumi L. Auctus Architectus</i>." It is
now converted into a church, in which they showed us huge
bones, which they affirm to have been of some giant.</p>

<p>We went to see the ruins of the old haven, so compact
with that bituminous sand in which the materials are laid,
as the like is hardly to be found, though all this has not
been sufficient to protect it from the fatal concussions of
several earthquakes (frequent here) which have almost
demolished it, thirteen vast piles of marble only remaining;
a stupendous work in the bosom of Neptune! To
this joins the bridge of Caligula, by which (having now
embarked ourselves) we sailed to the pleasant Baia, almost
four miles in length, all which way that proud Emperor
would pass in triumph. Here we rowed along toward a
villa of the orator Cicero's, where we were shown the
ruins of his Academy; and, at the foot of a rock, his
Baths, the waters reciprocating their tides with the neighboring
sea. Hard at hand, rises Mount Gaurus, being, as
I conceived, nothing save a heap of pumices, which here
float in abundance on the sea, exhausted of all inflammable
matter by the fire, which renders them light and
porous, so as the beds of nitre, which lie deep under
them, having taken fire, do easily eject them. They dig
much for fancied treasure said to be concealed about this
place. From hence, we coasted near the ruins of Portus
Julius, where we might see divers stately palaces that had
been swallowed up by the sea after earthquakes. Coming
to shore, we pass by the Lucrine Lake, so famous heretofore
for its delicious oysters, now producing few or none,
being divided from the sea by a bank of incredible labor,
the supposed work of Hercules; it is now half choked up
with rubbish, and by part of the new mountain, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
rose partly out of it, and partly out of the sea, and that
in the space of one night and a day, to a very great altitude,
on the 29th September, 1538, after many terrible
earthquakes, which ruined divers places thereabout, when
at midnight the sea retiring near 200 paces, and yawning
on the sudden, it continued to vomit forth flames and
fiery stones in such quantity, as produced this whole
mountain by their fall, making the inhabitants of Pozzolo
to leave their habitations, supposing the end of the world
had been come.</p>

<p>From the left part of this, we walked to the Lake
Avernus of a round form, and totally environed with
mountains. This lake was feigned by the poet for the
gates of hell, by which Æneas made his descent, and
where he sacrificed to Pluto and the Manes. The waters
are of a remarkably black color; but I tasted of them
without danger; hence, they feign that the river Styx
has its source. At one side, stand the handsome ruins
of a Temple dedicated to Apollo, or rather Pluto, but it
is controverted. Opposite to this, having new lighted
our torches, we enter a vast cave, in which having gone
about two hundred paces, we pass a narrow entry which
leads us into a room of about ten paces long, proportionably
broad and high; the side walls and roof retain
still the golden mosaic, though now exceedingly decayed
by time. Here is a short cell or rather niche, cut out
of the solid rock, somewhat resembling a couch, in which
they report that the Sibylla lay, and uttered her Oracles;
but it is supposed by most to have been a bath only.
This subterranean grot leads quite through to Cuma,
but is in some places obstructed by the earth which has
sunk in, so as we were constrained back again, and to
creep on our bellies, before we came to the light. It is
reported Nero had once resolved to cut a channel for
two great galleys that should have extended to Ostia,
150 miles distant. The people now call it Licola.</p>

<p>From hence, we ascended to that most ancient city of
Italy, the renowned Cuma, built by the Grecians. It
stands on a very eminent promontory, but is now a
heap of ruins. A little below, stands the Arco Felice,
heretofore part of Apollo's Temple, with the foundations
of divers goodly buildings; among whose heaps are frequently
found statues and other antiquities, by such as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
dig for them. Near this is the Lake Acherutia, and
Acheron. Returning to the shore, we came to the Bagni
de Tritoli and Diana, which are only long narrow passages
cut through the main rock, where the vapors
ascend so hot, that entering with the body erect you
will even faint with excessive perspiration; but, stooping
lower, as sudden a cold surprises. These sudatories are
much in request for many infirmities. Now we entered
the haven of the Bahiæ, where once stood that famous
town, so-called from the companion of Ulysses here
buried; not without great reason celebrated for one of
the most delicious places that the sun shines on, according
to that of Horace:</p>

<p class="centerquot">"<i>Nullus in Orbe locus Baiis prælucet amœnis.</i>"</p>

<p class="continue">Though, as to the stately fabrics, there now remain
little save the ruins, whereof the most entire is that of
Diana's Temple, and another of Venus. Here were those
famous poles of lampreys that would come to hand when
called by name, as Martial tells us. On the summit of
the rock stands a strong castle garrisoned to protect the
shore from Turkish pirates. It was once the retiring
place of Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p>Passing by the shore again, we entered Bauli, observable
from the monstrous murder of Nero committed on
his mother Agrippina. Her sepulchre was yet shown
us in the rock, which we entered, being covered with
sundry heads and figures of beasts. We saw there the
roots of a tree turned into stone, and are continually
dropping.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISENUS</div>

<p>Thus having viewed the foundations of the old Cimmeria,
the palaces of Marius, Pompey, Nero, Hortensius, and
other villas and antiquities, we proceeded toward the
promontory of Misenus, renowned for the sepulchre of
Æneas's Trumpeter. It was once a great city, now hardly
a ruin, said to have been built from this place to the
promontory of Minerva, fifty miles distant, now discontinued
and demolished by the frequent earthquakes. Here
was the villa of Caius Marius, where Tiberius Cæsar
died; and here runs the Aqueduct, thought to be dug by
Nero, a stupendous passage, heretofore nobly arched with
marble, as the ruins testify. Hence, we walked to those
receptacles of water called <i>Piscina Mirabilis</i>, being a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
vault of 500 feet long, and twenty-two in breadth, the
roof propped up with four ranks of square pillars, twelve
in a row; the walls are brick, plastered over with such
a composition as for strength and politure resembles
white marble. 'Tis conceived to have been built by Nero,
as a conservatory for fresh water; as were also the Centi
Camerelli, into which we were next led. All these crypta
being now almost sunk into the earth, show yet their
former amplitude and magnificence.</p>

<p>Returning toward the Baia, we again pass the Elysian
Fields, so celebrated by the poets, nor unworthily, for
their situation and verdure, being full of myrtles and
sweet shrubs, and having a most delightful prospect
toward the Tyrrhene Sea. Upon the verge of these
remain the ruins of the Mercato di Saboto, formerly a
Circus; over the arches stand divers urns, full of Roman
ashes.</p>

<p>Having well satisfied our curiosity among these antiquities,
we retired to our felucca, which rowed us back
again toward Pozzolo, at the very place of St. Paul's
landing. Keeping along the shore, they showed us a
place where the sea water and sands did exceedingly boil.
Thence, to the island Nesis, once the fabulous Nymph;
and thus we leave the Baia, so renowned for the sweet
retirements of the most opulent and voluptuous Romans.
They certainly were places of uncommon amenity, as
their yet tempting site, and other circumstances of natural
curiosities, easily invite me to believe, since there is not
in the world so many stupendous rarities to be met with,
as in the circle of a few miles which environ these blissful
abodes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPLES</div>
