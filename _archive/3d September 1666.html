<p>I had public prayers at home.
The fire continuing, after dinner, I took coach with my
wife and son, and went to the Bankside in Southwark,
where we beheld that dismal spectacle, the whole city in
dreadful flames near the waterside; all the houses from
the Bridge, all Thames street, and upward toward
Cheapside, down to the Three Cranes, were now consumed;
and so returned, exceedingly astonished what would become
of the rest.</p>

<p>The fire having continued all this night (if I may call
that night which was light as day for ten miles round
about, after a dreadful manner), when conspiring with a
fierce eastern wind in a very dry season, I went on foot
to the same place; and saw the whole south part of the
city burning from Cheapside to the Thames, and all along
Cornhill (for it likewise kindled back against the wind as
well as forward), Tower street, Fenchurch street, Gracious
street, and so along to Baynard's Castle, and was now
taking hold of St. Paul's church, to which the scaffolds
contributed exceedingly. The conflagration was so universal,
and the people so astonished, that, from the beginning,
I know not by what despondency, or fate, they
hardly stirred to quench it; so that there was nothing
heard, or seen, but crying out and lamentation, running
about like distracted creatures, without at all attempting
to save even their goods; such a strange consternation
there was upon them, so as it burned both in breadth and
length, the churches, public halls, Exchange, hospitals,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
monuments, and ornaments; leaping after a prodigious
manner, from house to house, and street to street, at great
distances one from the other. For the heat, with a long
set of fair and warm weather, had even ignited the air,
and prepared the materials to conceive the fire, which
devoured, after an incredible manner, houses, furniture,
and every thing. Here, we saw the Thames covered with
goods floating, all the barges and boats laden with what
some had time and courage to save, as, on the other side,
the carts, etc., carrying out to the fields, which for many
miles were strewn with movables of all sorts, and tents
erecting to shelter both people and what goods they could
get away. Oh, the miserable and calamitous spectacle!
such as haply the world had not seen since the foundation
of it, nor can be outdone till the universal conflagration
thereof. All the sky was of a fiery aspect, like the top of
a burning oven, and the light seen above forty miles
round about for many nights. God grant mine eyes may
never behold the like, who now saw above 10,000 houses
all in one flame! The noise and cracking and thunder of
the impetuous flames, the shrieking of women and children,
the hurry of people, the fall of towers, houses, and
churches, was like a hideous storm; and the air all
about so hot and inflamed, that at the last one was not
able to approach it, so that they were forced to stand
still, and let the flames burn on, which they did, for near
two miles in length and one in breadth. The clouds also
of smoke were dismal, and reached, upon computation,
near fifty miles in length. Thus, I left it this afternoon
burning, a resemblance of Sodom, or the last day. It
forcibly called to my mind that passageâ€”"<i>non enim hic
habemus stabilem civitatem</i>"; the ruins resembling the
picture of Troy. London was, but is no more! Thus, I
returned.</p>
