<p>Michaelmas day, I went with
my Lord Mowbray (eldest son to the Earl of Arundel,
and a most worthy person) to see the collection of a
noble Venetian, Signor Rugini. He has a stately palace,
richly furnished with statues and heads of Roman Emperors,
all placed in an ample room. In the next, was a
cabinet of medals, both Latin and Greek, with divers
curious shells and two fair pearls in two of them; but,
above all, he abounded in things petrified, walnuts, eggs
in which the yoke rattled, a pear, a piece of beef with
the bones in it, a whole hedgehog, a plaice on a wooden
trencher turned into stone and very perfect, charcoal, a
morsel of cork yet retaining its levity, sponges, and a
piece of taffety part rolled up, with innumerable more.
In another cabinet, supported by twelve pillars of oriental
agate, and railed about with crystal, he showed us several
noble intáglios of agate, especially a head of Tiberius,
a woman in a bath with her dog, some rare
cornelians, onyxes, crystals, etc., in one of which was a
drop of water not congealed, but moving up and down,
when shaken; above all, a diamond which had a very
fair ruby growing in it; divers pieces of amber, wherein
were several insects, in particular one cut like a heart
that contained in it a salamander without the least<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
defect, and many pieces of mosaic. The fabric of this
cabinet was very ingenious, set thick with agates, turquoises,
and other precious stones, in the midst of which
was an antique of a dog in stone scratching his ear,
very rarely cut, and comparable to the greatest curiosity
I had ever seen of that kind for the accurateness of the
work. The next chamber had a bedstead all inlaid with
agates, crystals, cornelians, lazuli, etc., esteemed worth
16,000 crowns, but, for the most part, the bedsteads in
Italy are of forged iron gilded, since it is impossible to
keep the wooden ones from the cimices.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PADUA</div>

<p>From hence, I returned to Padua, when that town
was so infested with soldiers, that many houses were
broken open in the night, some murders committed, and
the nuns next our lodging disturbed, so as we were
forced to be on our guard with pistols and other firearms
to defend our doors; and indeed the students themselves
take a barbarous liberty in the evenings when
they go to their strumpets, to stop all that pass by the
house where any of their companions in folly are with
them. This custom they call <i>chi vali</i>, so as the streets
are very dangerous, when the evenings grow dark; nor
is it easy to reform this intolerable usage, where there
are so many strangers of several nations.</p>

<p>Using to drink my wine cooled with snow and ice, as
the manner here is, I was so afflicted with an angina
and sore throat, that it had almost cost me my life.
After all the remedies Cavalier Veslingius, chief professor
here, could apply, old Salvatico (that famous physician)
being called, made me be cupped, and scarified in the
back in four places; which began to give me breath,
and consequently life; for I was in the utmost danger;
but, God being merciful to me, I was after a fortnight
abroad again, when, changing my lodging, I went over
against Pozzo Pinto; where I bought for winter provision
3,000 weight of excellent grapes, and pressed my own
wine, which proved incomparable liquor.</p>

<p>This was on 10th of <a id="tn_png_243"></a><!--TN: Period added after "October"-->October. Soon after came to visit
me from Venice Mr. Henry Howard, grandchild to the
Earl of Arundel, Mr. Bramstone, son to the Lord Chief
Justice, and Mr. Henshaw, with whom I went to another
part of the city to lodge near St. Catherine's over against
the monastery of nuns, where we hired the whole house,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
and lived very nobly. Here I learned to play on the
theorb, <a id="tn_png_244"></a><!--TN: "thought" changed to "taught"-->taught by Signor Dominico Bassano, who had a
daughter married to a doctor of laws, that played and
sung to nine several instruments, with that skill and
address as few masters in Italy exceeded her; she likewise
composed divers excellent pieces: I had never seen
any play on the Naples viol before. She presented me
afterward with two recitativos of hers, both words and
music.</p>
