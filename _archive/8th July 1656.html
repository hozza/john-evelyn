<p>To Colchester, a fair town, but now
wretchedly demolished by the late siege, especially the
suburbs, which were all burned, but were then repairing.
The town is built on a rising ground, having fair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
meadows on one side, and a river with a strong ancient
castle, said to have been built by King Coilus, father of
Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, of whom I find
no memory save at the pinnacle of one of their wool-staple
houses, where is a statue of Coilus, in wood,
wretchedly carved. The walls are exceedingly strong,
deeply trenched, and filled with earth. It has six gates,
and some watchtowers, and some handsome churches.
But what was shown us as a kind of miracle, at the outside
of the Castle, the wall where Sir Charles Lucas and
Sir George Lisle, those valiant and noble persons who
so bravely behaved themselves in the last siege, were
barbarously shot, murdered by Ireton in cold blood, after
surrendering on articles; having been disappointed of relief
from the Scotch army, which had been defeated
with the King at Worcester. The place was bare of
grass for a large space, all the rest of it abounding with
herbage. For the rest, this is a ragged and factious
town, now swarming with sectaries. Their trading is in
cloth with the Dutch, and baize and says with Spain; it
is the only place in England where these stuffs are made
unsophisticated. It is also famous for oysters and eringo
root, growing hereabout, and candied for sale.</p>

<p>Went to Dedham, a pretty country town, having a
very fair church, finely situated, the valley well watered.
Here, I met with Dr. Stokes, a young gentleman, but
an excellent mathematician. This is a clothing town, as
most are in Essex, but lies in the unwholesome hundreds.</p>

<p>Hence to Ipswich, doubtless one of the sweetest, most
pleasant, well-built towns in England. It has twelve
fair churches, many noble houses, especially the Lord
Devereux's; a brave quay, and commodious harbor, being
about seven miles from the main; an ample market place.
Here was born the great Cardinal Wolsey, who began a
palace here, which was not finished.</p>

<p>I had the curiosity to visit some Quakers here in prison;
a new fanatic sect, of dangerous principles, who show no
respect to any man, magistrate, or other, and seem a
melancholy, proud sort of people, and exceedingly ignorant.
One of these was said to have fasted twenty days;
but another, endeavoring to do the like, perished on the
10th, when he would have eaten, but could not.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>
