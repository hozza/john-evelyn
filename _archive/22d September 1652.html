<p>I went to Woodcott, where Lady
Browne was taken with scarlet fever, and died. She
was carried to Deptford, and interred in the church near
Sir Richard's relations with all decent ceremonies, and
according to the church-office, for which I obtained permission,
after it had not been used in that church for
seven years. Thus ended an excellent and virtuous lady,
universally lamented, having been so obliging on all occasions
to those who continually frequented her house in
Paris, which was not only an hospital, but an asylum to
all our persecuted and afflicted countrymen, during eleven
years' residence there in that honorable situation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>
