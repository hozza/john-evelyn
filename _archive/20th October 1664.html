<p>Hence, to see the famous wells,
natural and artificial grots and fountains, called Bushell's
Wells, at Enstone. This Bushell had been Secretary to
my Lord Verulam. It is an extraordinary solitude. There
he had two mummies; a grot where he lay in a hammock,
like an Indian. Hence, we went to Dichley, an ancient
seat of the Lees, now Sir Henry Lee's; it is a low ancient
timber-house, with a pretty bowling-green. My Lady gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
us an extraordinary dinner. This gentleman's mother was
Countess of Rochester, who was also there, and Sir Walter
St. John. There were some pictures of their ancestors,
not ill painted; the great-grandfather had been Knight
of the Garter; there was a picture of a Pope, and our
Savior's head. So we returned to Cornbury.</p>
