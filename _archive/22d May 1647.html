<p>My valet (Herbert) robbed me of
clothes and plate, to the value of three score pounds;
but, through the diligence of Sir Richard Browne, his
Majesty's Resident at the Court of France, and with
whose lady and family I had contracted a great friendship
(and particularly set my affections on a daughter),
I recovered most of them, obtaining of the Judge, with
no small difficulty, that the process against the thief
should not concern his life, being his first offense.</p>
