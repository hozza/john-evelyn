<p>The King's coronation day was
ordered not to be observed, as hitherto it had been.</p>

<p>The Convention of the Lords and Commons now declare
the Prince and Princess of Orange King and Queen of
England, France, and Ireland (Scotland being an independent
kingdom), the Prince and Princess being to
enjoy it jointly during their lives; but the executive
authority to be vested in the Prince during life, though
all proceedings to run in both names, and that it should
descend to their issue, and for want of such, to the
Princess Anne of Denmark and her issue, and in want
of such, to the heirs of the body of the Prince, if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
survive, and that failing, to devolve to the Parliament,
as they should think fit. These produced a conference
with the Lords, when also there was presented heads of
such new laws as were to be enacted. It is thought on
these conditions they will be proclaimed.</p>

<p>There was much contest about the King's abdication,
and whether he had vacated the government. The Earl
of Nottingham and about twenty Lords, and many Bishops,
entered their protests, but the concurrence was great
against them.</p>

<p>The Princess hourly expected. Forces sending to Ireland,
that kingdom being in great danger by the Earl of Tyrconnel's
army, and expectations from France coming to assist
them, but that King was busy in invading Flanders, and
encountering the German Princes. It is likely that this
will be the most remarkable summer for action, which
has happened in many years.</p>
