<p>About four in the afternoon, being
at bowls on the green, we discovered a vessel which
proved to be that in which my wife was, and which got
into the harbor about eight that evening, to my no small
joy. They had been three days at sea, and escaped the
Dutch fleet, through which they passed, taken for fishers,
which was great good fortune, there being seventeen
bales of furniture and other rich plunder, which I bless
God came all safe to land, together with my wife, and
my Lady Browne, her mother, who accompanied her.
My wife being discomposed by having been so long at
sea, we set not forth toward home till the 14th, when,
hearing the smallpox was very rife in and about London,
and Lady Browne having a desire to drink <span class="sidenote">TUNBRIDGE</span>Tunbridge
waters, I carried them thither, and stayed in a very
sweet place, private and refreshing, and took the waters
myself till the 23d, when I went to prepare for their
reception, leaving them for the present in their little
cottage by the Wells.</p>

<p>The weather being hot, and having sent my man on
before, I rode negligently under favor of the shade, till,
within three miles of Bromley, at a place called the
Procession Oak, two cutthroats started out, and striking
with long staves at the horse, and taking hold of the
reins, threw me down, took my sword, and hauled me
into a deep thicket, some quarter of a mile from the highway,
where they might securely rob me, as they soon
did. What they got of money, was not considerable,
but they took two rings, the one an emerald with diamonds,
the other an onyx, and a pair of buckles set
with rubies and diamonds, which were of value, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
after all bound my hands behind me, and my feet, having
before pulled off my boots; they then set me up
against an oak, with most bloody threats to cut my throat
if I offered to cry out, or make any noise; for they
should be within hearing, I not being the person they
looked for. I told them that if they had not basely surprised
me they should not have had so easy a prize,
and that it would teach me never to ride near a hedge,
since, had I been in the midway, they dared not have
adventured on me; at which they cocked their pistols,
and told me they had long guns, too, and were fourteen
companions. I begged for my onyx, and told them it
being engraved with my arms would betray them; but
nothing prevailed. My horse's bridle they slipped, and
searched the saddle, which they pulled off, but let the
horse graze, and then turning again bridled him and
tied him to a tree, yet so as he might graze, and thus
left me bound. My horse was perhaps not taken, because
he was marked and cropped on both ears, and
well known on that road. Left in this manner, grievously
was I tormented with flies, ants, and the sun, nor
was my anxiety little how I should get loose in that
solitary place, where I could neither hear nor see any
creature but my poor horse and a few sheep straggling
in the copse.</p>

<p>After near two hours attempting, I got my hands to turn
palm to palm, having been tied back to back, and then it was
long before I could slip the cord over my wrists to
my thumb, which at last I did, and then soon unbound
my feet, and saddling my horse and roaming
a while about, I at last perceived dust to rise, and
soon after heard the rattling of a cart, toward which
I made, and, by the help of two countrymen, I got
back into the highway. I rode to Colonel Blount's, a
great justiciary of the times, who sent out hue and
cry immediately. The next morning, sore as my wrists
and arms were, I went to London, and got 500 tickets
printed and dispersed by an officer of Goldsmiths' Hall,
and within two days had tidings of all I had lost, except
my sword, which had a silver hilt, and some trifles.
The rogues had pawned one of my rings for a trifle
to a goldsmith's servant, before the tickets came to
the shop, by which means they escaped; the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
ring was bought by a victualer, who brought it to a
goldsmith, but he having seen the ticket seized the
man. I afterward discharged him on his protestation
of innocence. Thus did God deliver me from these
villains, and not only so, but restored what they took,
as twice before he had graciously done, both at sea and
land, I mean when I had been robbed by pirates, and
was in danger of a considerable loss at Amsterdam; for
which, and many, many signal preservations, I am extremely
obliged to give thanks to God my Savior.</p>
