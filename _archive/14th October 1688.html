<p>The King's birthday. No guns
from the Tower as usual. The sun eclipsed at its rising.
This day signal for the victory of William the Conqueror
against Harold, near Battel, in Sussex. The wind, which
had been hitherto west, was east all this day. Wonderful
expectation of the Dutch fleet. Public prayers ordered
to be read in the churches against invasion.</p>
