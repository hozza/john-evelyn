<p>I was invited to the translation of
Dr. Sheldon, Bishop of London, from that see to Canterbury,
the ceremony performed at Lambeth. First, went
his Grace's mace bearer, steward, treasurer, comptroller,
all in their gowns, and with white staves; next, the
bishops in their habits, eight in number; Dr. Sweate,
Dean of the Arches, Dr. Exton, Judge of the Admiralty,
Sir William Merick, Judge of the Prerogative Court, with
divers advocates in scarlet. After divine service in the
chapel, performed with music extraordinary, Dr. French
and Dr. Stradling (his Grace's chaplains) said prayers.
The Archbishop in a private room looking into the chapel,
the bishops, who were commissioners, went up to a table
placed before the altar, and sat round it in chairs. Then
Dr. Chaworth presented the commission under the broad
seal to the Bishop of Winchester, and it was read by Dr.
Sweate. After which, the Vicar-General went to the vestry,
and brought his Grace into the chapel, his other officers
marching before. He being presented to the Commis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>sioners,
was seated in a great armchair at one end of
the table, when the definitive sentence was read by the
Bishop of Winchester, and subscribed by all the bishops,
and proclamation was three times made at the chapel
door, which was then set open for any to enter, and give
their exceptions; if any they had. This done, we all
went to dinner in the great hall to a mighty feast. There
were present all the nobility in town, the Lord Mayor of
London, Sheriffs, Duke of Albemarle, etc. My Lord
Archbishop did in particular most civilly welcome me.
So going to visit my Lady Needham, who lived at Lambeth,
I went over to London.</p>
