<p>Being called into his Majesty's
closet when Mr.Â Cooper, the rare limner, was crayoning
of the King's face and head, to make the stamps for the
new milled money now contriving, I had the honor to
hold the candle while it was doing, he choosing the night
and candlelight for the better finding out the shadows.
During this, his Majesty discoursed with me on several
things relating to painting and graving.</p>
