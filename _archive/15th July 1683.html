<p>A stranger, an old man, preached on
Jerem. vi. 8, the not hearkening to instruction, portentous
of desolation to a people; much after Bishop Andrew's
method, full of logical divisions, in short and
broken periods, and Latin sentences, now quite out of
fashion in the pulpit, which is grown into a far more
profitable way, of plain and practical discourses, of which
sort this nation, or any other, never had greater plenty
or more profitable (I am confident); so much has it to
answer for thriving no better on it.</p>

<p>The public was now in great consternation on the
late plot and conspiracy; his Majesty very melancholy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and not stirring without double guards; all the avenues
and private doors about Whitehall and the Park shut
up, few admitted to walk in it. The Papists, in the
meantime, very jocund; and indeed with reason, seeing
their own plot brought to nothing, and turned to ridicule,
and now a conspiracy of Protestants, as they called
them.</p>

<p>The Turks were likewise in hostility against the German
Emperor, almost masters of the Upper Hungary,
and drawing toward Vienna. On the other side, the
French King (who it is believed brought in the infidels)
disturbing his Spanish and Dutch neighbors, having swallowed
up almost all Flanders, pursuing his ambition of
a fifth universal monarchy; and all this blood and disorder
in Christendom had evidently its rise from our defections
at home, in a wanton peace, minding nothing but luxury,
ambition, and to procure money for our vices. To this
add our irreligion and atheism, great ingratitude, and
self-interest; the apostacy of some, and the suffering
the French to grow so great, and the Hollanders so
weak. In a word, we were wanton, mad, and surfeiting
with prosperity; every moment unsettling the old foundations,
and never constant to anything. The Lord in
mercy avert the sad omen, and that we do not provoke
him till he bear it no longer!</p>

<p>This summer did we suffer twenty French men-of-war
to pass our Channel toward the Sound, to help the Danes
against the Swedes, who had abandoned the French interest,
we not having ready sufficient to guard our coasts,
or take cognizance of what they did; though the nation
never had more, or a better navy, yet the sea had never
so slender a fleet.</p>
