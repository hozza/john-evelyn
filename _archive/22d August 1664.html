<p>I went from London to Wotton, to
assist at the funeral of my sister-in-law, the Lady Cotton,
buried in our dormitory there, she being put up in lead.
Dr. Owen made a profitable and pathetic discourse, concluding
with an eulogy of that virtuous, pious, and deserving
lady. It was a very solemn funeral, with about
fifty mourners. I came back next day with my wife to
London.</p>
