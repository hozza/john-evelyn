<p>Dined at the Lord Mayor's; and,
in the evening, went to the funeral of my pious, dear,
and ancient learned friend, Dr. Jasper Needham, who
was buried at St. Bride's Church. He was a true and
holy Christian, and one who loved me with great affection.
Dr. Dove preached with an eulogy due to his
memory. I lost in this person one of my dearest remaining
sincere friends.</p>
