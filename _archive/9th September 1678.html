<p>She died in the 26th year of her
age, to the inexpressible affliction of her dear husband,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
and all her relations, but of none in the world more than
of myself, who lost the most excellent and inestimable
friend that ever lived. Never was a more virtuous and
inviolable friendship; never a more religious, discreet,
and admirable creature, beloved of all, admired of all,
for all possible perfections of her sex. She is gone to
receive the reward of her signal charity, and all other
her Christian graces, too blessed a creature to converse
with mortals, fitted as she was, by a most holy life, to
be received into the mansions above. She was for wit,
beauty, good nature, fidelity, discretion, and all accomplishments,
the most incomparable person. How shall I
ever repay the obligations to her for the infinite good
offices she did my soul by so often engaging me to make
religion the terms and tie of the friendship there was
between us! She was the best wife, the best mistress,
the best friend, that ever husband had. But it is not
here that I pretend to give her character, <span class="small">HAVING DESIGNED
TO CONSECRATE HER WORTHY LIFE TO POSTERITY</span>.</p>

<p>Her husband, struck with unspeakable affliction, fell
down as dead. The King himself, and all the Court,
expressed their sorrow. To the poor and miserable, her
loss was irreparable; for there was no degree but had
some obligation to her memory. So careful and provident
was she to be prepared for all possible accidents,
that (as if she foresaw her end) she received the heavenly
viaticum but the Sunday before, after a most solemn
recollection. She put all her domestic concerns into
the exactest order, and left a letter directed to her husband,
to be opened in case she died in childbed, in
which with the most pathetic and endearing expressions
of the most loyal and virtuous wife, she begs his kindness
to her memory might be continued by his care and
esteem of those she left behind, even to her domestic
servants, to the meanest of which she left considerable
legacies, as well as to the poor. It was now seven years
since she was maid of honor to the Queen, that she regarded
me as a father, a brother, and what is more, a
friend. We often prayed, visited the sick and miserable,
received, read, discoursed, and communicated in all holy
offices together. She was most dear to my wife, and
affectionate to my children. But she is gone! This only
is my comfort, that she is happy in Christ, and I shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
shortly behold her again. She desired to be buried in
the dormitory of his family, near three hundred miles
from all her other friends. So afflicted was her husband
at this severe loss, that the entire care of her funeral
was committed to me. Having closed the eyes, and
dropped a tear upon the cheek of my dear departed friend,
lovely even in death, I caused her corpse to be embalmed
and wrapped in lead, a plate of brass soldered thereon,
with an inscription, and other circumstances due to her
worth, with as much diligence and care as my grieved
heart would permit me; I then retired home for two days,
which were spent in solitude and sad reflection.</p>
