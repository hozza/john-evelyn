<p>Sir Hugh Pollard, Comptroller
of the Household, died at Whitehall, and his Majesty conferred
the white staff on my brother Commissioner for
sick and wounded, Sir Thomas Clifford, a bold young gentleman,
of a small fortune in Devon, but advanced by
Lord Arlington, Secretary of State, to the great astonishment
of all the Court. This gentleman was somewhat
related to me by the marriage of his mother to my nearest
kinsman, Gregory Coale, and was ever my noble friend, a
valiant and daring person, but by no means fit for a supple
and flattering courtier.</p>
