<p>I went to visit my worthy neighbor,
Sir Henry Newton [at Charlton], and consider the prospect,
which is doubtless for city, river, ships, meadows,
hill, woods, and all other amenities, one of the
most noble in the world; so as, had the house running
water, it were a princely seat. Mr.Â Henshaw and his
brother-in-law came to visit me, and he presented me
with a seleniscope.</p>
