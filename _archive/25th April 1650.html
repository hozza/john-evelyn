<p>I went out of town to see Madrid, a
palace so called, built by Francis I. It is observable
only for its open manner of architecture, being much
of terraces and galleries one over another to the very
roof; and for the materials, which are mostly of earth
painted like porcelain, or China-ware, whose colors appear
very fresh, but is very fragile. There are whole statues
and relievos of this pottery, chimney-pieces, and columns
both within and without. Under the chapel is a chimney
in the midst of a room parted from the <i>Salle des Gardes</i>.
The house is fortified with a deep ditch, and has an admirable
vista toward the Bois de Boulogne and river.</p>
