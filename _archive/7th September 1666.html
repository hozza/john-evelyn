<p>I went this morning on foot from
Whitehall as far as London Bridge, through the late Fleet
street, Ludgate hill by St. Paul's, Cheapside, Exchange,
Bishops-gate, Aldersgate, and out to Moorfields, thence
through Cornhill, etc., with extraordinary difficulty, clambering
over heaps of yet smoking rubbish, and frequently
mistaking where I was; the ground under my feet so hot,
that it even burnt the soles of my shoes. In the meantime,
his Majesty got to the Tower by water, to demolish
the houses about the graff, which, being built entirely
about it, had they taken fire and attacked the White
Tower, where the magazine of powder lay, would undoubtedly
not only have beaten down and destroyed all the
bridge, but sunk and torn the vessels in the river, and
rendered the demolition beyond all expression for several
miles about the country.</p>

<p>At my return, I was infinitely concerned to find that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
goodly Church, St. Paul'sâ€”now a sad ruin, and that
beautiful portico (for structure comparable to any in
Europe, as not long before repaired by the late King) now
rent in pieces, flakes of large stones split asunder, and
nothing remaining entire but the inscription in the architrave
showing by whom it was built, which had not one
letter of it defaced! It was astonishing to see what immense
stones the heat had in a manner calcined, so that all
the ornaments, columns, friezes, capitals, and projectures of
massy Portland stone, flew off, even to the very roof, where
a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than six
acres by measure) was totally melted. The ruins of the
vaulted roof falling, broke into St. Faith's, which being
filled with the magazines of books belonging to the Stationers,
and carried thither for safety, they were all consumed,
burning for a week following. It is also observable
that the lead over the altar at the east end was untouched,
and among the divers monuments the body of one bishop
remained entire. Thus lay in ashes that most venerable
church, one of the most ancient pieces of early piety in
the Christian world, besides near one hundred more. The
lead, ironwork, bells, plate, etc., melted, the exquisitely
wrought Mercers' Chapel, the sumptuous Exchange, the
august fabric of Christ Church, all the rest of the Companies'
Halls, splendid buildings, arches, entries, all in dust;
the fountains dried up and ruined, while the very waters
remained boiling; the voragos of subterranean cellars,
wells, and dungeons, formerly warehouses, still burning in
stench and dark clouds of smoke; so that in five or six
miles traversing about I did not see one load of timber
unconsumed, nor many stones but what were calcined
white as snow.</p>

<p>The people, who now walked about the ruins, appeared
like men in some dismal desert, or rather, in some great
city laid waste by a cruel enemy; to which was added
the stench that came from some poor creatures' bodies,
beds, and other combustible goods. Sir Thomas Gresham's
statue, though fallen from its niche in the Royal Exchange,
remained entire, when all those of the Kings since
the Conquest were broken to pieces. Also the standard
in Cornhill, and Queen Elizabeth's effigies, with some arms
on Ludgate, continued with but little detriment, while the
vast iron chains of the city streets, hinges, bars, and gates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of prisons, were many of them melted and reduced to
cinders by the vehement heat. Nor was I yet able to pass
through any of the narrow streets, but kept the widest;
the ground and air, smoke and fiery vapor, continued so
intense, that my hair was almost singed, and my feet insufferably
surbated. The by-lanes and narrow streets
were quite filled up with rubbish; nor could one have
possibly known where he was, but by the ruins of some
Church, or Hall, that had some remarkable tower, or pinnacle
remaining.</p>

<p>I then went towards Islington and Highgate, where one
might have seen 200,000 people of all ranks and degrees
dispersed, and lying along by their heaps of what they
could save from the fire, deploring their loss; and, though
ready to perish for hunger and destitution, yet not asking
one penny for relief, which to me appeared a stranger
sight than any I had yet beheld. His Majesty and Council
indeed took all imaginable care for their relief, by proclamation
for the country to come in, and refresh them
with provisions.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this calamity and confusion, there
was, I know not how, an alarm begun that the French
and Dutch, with whom we were now in hostility, were not
only landed, but even entering the city. There was, in
truth, some days before, great suspicion of those two
nations joining; and now that they had been the occasion
of firing the town. This report did so terrify, that on a
sudden there was such an uproar and tumult that they
ran from their goods, and, taking what weapons they could
come at, they could not be stopped from falling on some
of those nations whom they casually met, without sense
or reason. The clamor and peril grew so excessive, that
it made the whole Court amazed, and they did with
infinite pains and great difficulty, reduce and appease the
people, sending troops of soldiers and guards, to cause
them to retire into the fields again, where they were
watched all this night. I left them pretty quiet, and
came home sufficiently weary and broken. Their spirits
thus a little calmed, and the affright abated, they now
began to repair into the suburbs about the city, where
such as had friends, or opportunity, got shelter for the
present to which his Majesty's proclamation also invited
them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Still, the plague continuing in our parish, I could not,
without danger, adventure to our church.</p>
