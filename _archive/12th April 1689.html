<p>I went with the Bishop of St. Asaph
to visit my Lord of Canterbury at Lambeth, who had
excused himself from officiating at the coronation, which
was performed by the Bishop of London, assisted by the
Archbishop of York. We had much private and free discourse
with his Grace concerning several things relating
to the Church, there being now a bill of comprehension
to be brought from the Lords to the Commons. I urged
that when they went about to reform some particulars
in the Liturgy, Church discipline, Canons, etc., the baptizing
in private houses without necessity might be
reformed, as likewise so frequent burials in churches;
the one proceeding much from the pride of women, bringing
that into custom which was only indulged in case
of imminent danger, and out of necessity during the
rebellion, and persecution of the clergy in our late civil
wars; the other from the avarice of ministers, who, in
some opulent parishes, made almost as much of permission
to bury in the chancel and the church, as of their
livings, and were paid with considerable advantage and
gifts for baptizing in chambers. To this they heartily
assented, and promised their endeavor to get it reformed,
utterly disliking both practices as novel and indecent.</p>

<p>We discoursed likewise of the great disturbance and
prejudice it might cause, should the new oath, now on
the anvil, be imposed on any, save such as were in new
office, without any retrospect to such as either had no
office, or had been long in office, who it was likely would
have some scruples about taking a new oath, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
already sworn fidelity to the government as established by
law. This we all knew to be the case of my Lord Archbishop
of Canterbury, and some other persons who were
not so fully satisfied with the Convention making it an
abdication of King James, to whom they had sworn allegiance.</p>

<p>King James was now certainly in Ireland with the Marshal
d'Estrades, whom he made a Privy Councillor; and
who caused the King to remove the Protestant Councillors,
some whereof, it seems, had continued to sit, telling
him that the King of France, his master, would never assist
him if he did not immediately do it; by which it
is apparent how the poor Prince is managed by the
French.</p>

<p>Scotland declares for King William and Queen Mary,
with the reasons of their setting aside King James, not
as abdicating, but forfeiting his right by <a id="tn_png_307"></a><!--TN: "mal-administration" changed to "maladministration" on Page 294-->maladministration;
they proceeded with much more caution and prudence
than we did, who precipitated all things to the
great reproach of the nation, all which had been managed
by some crafty, ill-principled men. The new Privy
Council have a Republican spirit, manifestly undermining
all future succession of the Crown and prosperity of the
Church of England, which yet I hope they will not be
able to accomplish so soon as they expect, though they
get into all places of trust and profit.</p>
