<p>The Parliament was adjourned
to February, several both of Lords and Commons excepting
against some passage of his Majesty's speech relating
to the Test, and continuance of Popish officers in
command. This was a great surprise in a Parliament
which people believed would have complied in all things.</p>

<p>Popish pamphlets and pictures sold publicly; no books
nor answers to them appearing till long after.</p>
