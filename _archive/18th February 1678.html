<p>My Lord Treasurer sent for me
to accompany him to Wimbledon, which he had lately
purchased of the Earl of Bristol; so breaking fast with
him privately in his chamber, I accompanied him with
two of his daughters, my Lord Conway, and Sir Bernard
Gascoyne; and, having surveyed his gardens and alterations,
returned late at night.</p>
