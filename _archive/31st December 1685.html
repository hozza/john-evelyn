<p>Recollecting the passages of the
year past, and having made up accounts, humbly besought
Almighty God to pardon those my sins which had
provoked him to discompose my sorrowful family; that
he would accept of our humiliation, and in his good time
restore comfort to it. I also blessed God for all his undeserved
mercies and preservations, begging the continuance
of his grace and preservation. The winter had hitherto
been extraordinarily wet and mild.</p>

<p>1st January, 1685-6. Imploring the continuance of
God's providential care for the year now entered, I
went to the public devotions. The Dean of the Chapel
and Clerk of the Closet put out, viz, Bishop of London<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
and ..., and Rochester and Durham put in their
places; the former had opposed the toleration intended,
and shown a worthy zeal for the reformed religion as
established.</p>
