<p>We walked to St. Nicholas in
Carcere; it has a fair front, and within are parts of the
bodies of St. Mark and Marcellino; on the Tribuna is a
painting of Gentileschi, and the altar of Caval; Baglioni,
with some other rare paintings. Coming round
from hence we passed by the Circus Flaminius, formerly
very large, now totally in ruins. In the afternoon, we
visited the English Jesuits, with whose Superior, P. Stafford,
I was well acquainted; who received us courteously.
They call their church and college St. Thomasso de gli
Inglesi, and is a seminary. Among other trifles, they
show the relics of Becket, their reputed martyr. Of
paintings there is one of Durante, and many representing
the sufferings of several of their society executed in
England, especially F. Campion.</p>

<p>In the Hospital of the Pelerini della S. Trinita, I had
seen the feet of many pilgrims washed by Princes, Cardinals,
and noble Romans, and served at table, as the
ladies and noble women did to other poor creatures in
another room. It was told us that no less than 444,000
men had been thus treated in the Jubilee of 1600, and
25,500 women, as appears by the register, which brings
store of money.</p>

<p>Returning homeward, I saw the palace of Cardinal
Spada, where is a most magnificent hall painted by Daniel
de Volterra and Giulio Piacentino, who made the fret in
the little Court; but the rare perspectives are of Bolognesi.
Near this is the Mont Pieta, instituted as a bank
for the poor, who, if the sum be not great, may have
money upon pawns. To this joins St. Martino, to which
belongs a Schola, or Corporation, that do many works of
charity. Hence we came through Campo di Fiori, or
herb-market, in the midst of which is a fountain casting
out water of a dolphin, in copper; and in this piazza is
common execution done.</p>
