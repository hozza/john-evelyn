<p>This night was buried in Westminster Abbey the Queen
of Bohemia, after all her sorrows and afflictions being
come to die in the arms of her nephew, the King; also
this night and the next day fell such a storm of hail,
thunder, and lightning, as never was seen the like in any
man's memory, especially the tempest of wind, being
southwest, which subverted, besides huge trees, many
houses, innumerable chimneys (among others that of my
parlor at Sayes Court), and made such havoc at land
and sea, that several perished on both. Divers lamentable
fires were also kindled at this time; so exceedingly was
God's hand against this ungrateful and vicious nation
and Court.</p>
