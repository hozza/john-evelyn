<p>I took a wagon for Dort, to be
present at the reception of the Queen-mother, Marie de
Medicis, Dowager of France, widow of Henry the Great,
and mother to the French King, Louis XIII., and the
Queen of England, whence she newly arrived, tossed to
and fro by the various fortune of her life. From this
city, she designed for Cologne, conducted by the Earl
of Arundel and the Herr Van Bredrod. At this interview,
I saw the Princess of Orange, and the lady her
daughter, afterward married to the House of Brandenburgh.
There was little remarkable in this reception
befitting the greatness of her person; but an universal
discontent, which accompanied that unlucky woman
wherever she went.</p>
