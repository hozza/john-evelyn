<p>We sailed by several Spanish forts,
out of one of which, St. Mary's port, came a Don on board
us, to whom I showed my Spanish pass, which he signed,
and civilly dismissed us. Hence, sailing by another man-of-war,
to which we lowered our topsails, we at length
arrived at Antwerp.</p>

<p>The lodgings here are very handsome and convenient.
I lost little time; but, with the aid of one Mr. Lewkner,
our conductor, we visited divers churches, colleges, and
monasteries. The Church of the Jesuits is most sumptuous
and magnificent; a glorious fabric without and within,
wholly incrusted with marble, inlaid and polished into
divers representations of histories, landscapes, and flowers.
On the high altar is placed the statue of the Blessed
Virgin and our Savior in white marble, with a boss in
the girdle set with very fair and rich sapphires, and divers
other stones of price. The choir is a glorious piece of
architecture: the pulpit supported by four angels, and
adorned with other carvings, and rare pictures by Rubens,
now lately dead, and divers votive tables and relics. Hence,
to the Vroù Kirk, or Nôtre Dame of Antwerp: it is a
very venerable fabric, built after the Gothic manner, especially
the tower, which I ascended, the better to take a
view of the country adjacent; which, happening on a day
when the sun shone exceedingly bright, and darted his
rays without any interruption, afforded so bright a reflection
to us who were above, and had a full prospect of
both land and water about it, that I was much confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
in my opinion of the moon's being of some such substance
as this earthly globe: perceiving all the subjacent country,
at so small an horizontal distance, to repercuss such a
light as I could hardly look against, save where the river,
and other large water within our view, appeared of a
more dark and uniform color; resembling those spots in
the moon supposed to be seas there, according to Hevelius,
and as they appear in our late telescopes. I numbered
in this church thirty privileged altars, that of St. Sebastian
adorned with a painting of his martyrdom.</p>

<p>We went to see the Jerusalem Church, affirmed to
have been founded by one who, upon divers great wagers,
passed to and fro between that city and Antwerp, on
foot, by which he procured large sums of money, which
he bestowed on this pious structure.<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13_13">13</a> Hence, to St.
Mary's Chapel, where I had some conference with two
English Jesuits, confessors to Colonel Jaye's regiment.
These fathers conducted us to the Cloister of Nuns,
where we heard a Dutch sermon upon the exposure of
the Host. The Senate-house of this city is a very spacious
and magnificent building.</p>
