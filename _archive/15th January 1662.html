<p>There was a general fast through
the whole nation, and now celebrated in London, to avert
God's heavy judgments on this land. Great rain had
fallen without any frost, or seasonable cold, not only in
England, but in Sweden, and the most northern parts,
being here near as warm as at midsummer in some years.</p>

<p>This solemn fast was held for the House of Commons
at St. Margaret's. Dr. Reeves, Dean of Windsor,
preached on Joshua vii. 12, showing how the neglect of
exacting justice on offenders (by which he insinuated
such of the old King's murderers as were yet reprieved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
and in the Tower) was a main cause of God's punishing
a land. He brought in that of the Gibeonites, as well as
Achan and others, concluding with an eulogy of the Parliament
for their loyalty in restoring the Bishops and
Clergy, and vindicating the Church from sacrilege.</p>
