<p>We went to St. John's, saw the library
and the two skeletons, which are finely cleansed and put
together; observable is here also the store of mathematical
instruments, chiefly given by the late Archbishop Laud,
who built here a handsome quadrangle.</p>

<p>Thence we went to New College, where the chapel
was in its ancient garb, notwithstanding the scrupulosity
of the times. Thence, to Christ's Church, in whose
library was shown us an Office of Henry VIII., the
writing, miniatures, and gilding whereof is equal, if not
surpassing, any curiosity I had seen of that kind; it was
given by their founder, Cardinal Wolsey. The glass win<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>dows
of the cathedral (famous in my time) I found much
abused. The ample hall and column, that spreads its
capital to sustain the roof as one goes up the stairs, is
very remarkable.</p>

<p>Next we walked to Magdalen College, where we saw
the library and chapel, which was likewise in pontifical
order, the altar only I think turned tablewise, and there
was still the double organ, which abominations (as now
esteemed) were almost universally demolished; Mr.Â Gibbon,
that famous musician, giving us a taste of his skill
and talents on that instrument.</p>

<p>Hence, to the Physic Garden, where the sensitive plant
was shown us for a great wonder. There grew canes,
olive trees, rhubarb, but no extraordinary curiosities, besides
very good fruit, which, when the ladies had tasted,
we returned in our coach to our lodgings.</p>
