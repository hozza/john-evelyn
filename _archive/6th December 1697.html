<p>I went to Kensington with the
Sheriff, Knights, and chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present
their address to the King. The Duke of Norfolk
promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came. This insignificant ceremony
was brought in in Cromwell's time, and has ever since
continued with offers of life and fortune to whoever
happened to have the power. I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey.
When we had half dined, the Duke of Norfolk
came in to make his excuse.</p>
