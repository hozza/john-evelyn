<p>At London, I heard an extraordinary
case before a Committee of the whole House of
Commons, in the Commons' House of Parliament, between
one Captain Taylor and my Lord Viscount Mordaunt,
where, after the lawyers had pleaded and the witnesses
been examined, such foul and dishonorable things were
produced against his Lordship, of tyranny during his
government of Windsor Castle, of which he was Constable,
incontinence, and suborning witnesses (of which last, one
Sir Richard Breames was most concerned), that I was exceedingly
interested for his Lordship, who was my special
friend, and husband of the most virtuous lady in the world.
We sat till near ten at night, and yet but half the counsel
had done on behalf of the plaintiff. The question then
was put for bringing in of lights to sit longer. This lasted
so long before it was determined, and raised such a con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>fused
noise among the members, that a stranger would
have been astonished at it. I admire that there is not a
rationale to regulate such trifling accidents, which consume
much time, and is a reproach to the gravity of so great an
assembly of sober men.</p>
