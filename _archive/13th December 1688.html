<p>The King flies to sea, puts in at
Faversham for ballast; is rudely treated by the people;
comes back to Whitehall.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange is advanced to Windsor, is invited
by the King to St. James's, the messenger sent was the
Earl of Faversham, the General of the Forces, who going
without trumpet, or passport, is detained prisoner by the
Prince, who accepts the invitation, but requires his Majesty
to retire to some distant place, that his own guards may
be quartered about the palace and city. This is taken
heinously and the King goes privately to Rochester; is
persuaded to come back; comes on the Sunday; goes to
mass, and dines in public, a Jesuit saying grace (I was
present).</p>
