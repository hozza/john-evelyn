<p>There happened this week so
thick a mist and fog, that people lost their way in the
streets, it being so intense that no light of candles, or
torches, yielded any (or but very little) direction. I was
in it, and in danger. Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and
Kensington on both sides, and while coaches and travelers
were passing. It began about four in the afternoon,
and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it. At the Thames, they beat drums to direct
the watermen to make the shore.</p>

<p>19th November, <a id="tn_png_361"></a><!--TN: Period added after "1699"-->1699. At our chapel in the evening
there was a sermon preached by young Mr. Horneck,
chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's funeral had been
celebrated magnificently the Thursday before. A panegyric
was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary
piety and excellently employed life of this amiable young
lady. She died in childbed a few days before, to the
excessive sorrow of her husband, who ordered the
preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the
course of his life, which was before in great danger of
being perverted; following the mode of this dissolute
age. Her devotion, early piety, charity, fastings, economy,
disposition of her time in reading, praying, recollections
in her own handwriting of what she heard and
read, and her conversation were most exemplary.</p>
