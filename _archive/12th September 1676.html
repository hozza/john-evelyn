<p>To London, to take order about
the building of a house, or rather an apartment, which
had all the conveniences of a house, for my dear friend,
Mr. Godolphin and lady, which I undertook to contrive
and survey, and employ workmen until it should be quite
finished; it being just over against his Majesty's wood-yard
by the Thames side, leading to Scotland Yard.</p>
