<p>Dined with the Dutch Ambassador.
He did in a manner acknowledge that his nation
mind only their own profit, do nothing out of gratitude,
but collaterally as it relates to their gain, or security;
and therefore the English were to look for nothing of
assistance to the banished King. This was to me no very
grateful discourse, though an ingenuous confession.</p>
