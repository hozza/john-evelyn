<p>Such storms, rain, and foul weather,
seldom known at this time of the year. The camp at
Hounslow Heath, from sickness and other inconveniences
of weather, forced to retire to quarters; the storms being
succeeded by excessive hot weather, many grew sick.
Great feasting there, especially in Lord Dunbarton's
quarters. There were many jealousies and discourses of
what was the meaning of this encampment.</p>

<p>A seal this day; mostly pardons and discharges of
Knight Baronets' fees, which having been passed over for
so many years, did greatly disoblige several families who
had served his Majesty. Lord Tyrconnel gone to Ireland,
with great powers and commissions, giving as much cause
of talk as the camp, especially nineteen new Privy-Coun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>cillors
and Judges being now made, among which but
three Protestants, and Tyrconnel made General.</p>

<p>New judges also here, among which was Milton, a
Papist (brother to that Milton who wrote for the Regicides),
who presumed to take his place without passing
the Test. Scotland refused to grant liberty of mass to
the Papists there.</p>

<p>The French persecution more inhuman than ever. The
Protestants in Savoy successfully resist the French dragoons
sent to murder them.</p>

<p>The King's chief physician in Scotland apostatizing
from the Protestant religion, does of his own accord
publish his recantation at Edinburg.</p>
