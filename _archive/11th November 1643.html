<p>Having a reasonable good
passage, though the weather was snowy and untoward
enough, we came before Calais, where, as we went on
shore, mistaking the tide, our shallop struck on the sands,
with no little danger; but at length we got off.</p>

<p>Calais is considered an extraordinary well-fortified
place, in the old castle and new citadel regarding the
sea. The haven consists of a long bank of sand, lying
opposite to it. The market place and the church are remarkable
things, besides those relics of our former dominion
there. I remember there were engraven in stone,
upon the front of an ancient dwelling which was showed
us, these words in Englishâ€”"God save the King," together
with the name of the architect and date. The
walls of the town are substantial; but the situation toward
the land is not pleasant, by reason of the marshes
and low grounds about it.</p>
