<p>I spent this whole day in exercises.
A stranger preached at Whitehall<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_44_44">44</a> on Luke xvi.
30, 31. I then went to St. Martin's, where the Bishop
of St. Asaph preached on 1 Peter iii. 15; the Holy Communion
followed, at which I participated, humbly imploring
God's assistance in the great work I was entering
into. In the afternoon, I heard Dr. Sprat, at St. Margaret's,
on Acts xvii. 11.</p>

<p>I began and spent the whole week in examining my
life, begging pardon for my faults, assistance and blessing
for the future, that I might, in some sort, be prepared
for the time that now drew near, and not have the
great work to begin, when one can work no longer. The
Lord Jesus help and assist me! I therefore stirred little
abroad till the 5th of November, when I heard Dr. Tenison,
the now vicar of St. Martin's; Dr. Lloyd, the former incumbent,
being made Bishop of St. Asaph.</p>
