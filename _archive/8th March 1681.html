<p>Visited and dined at the Earl of
Essex's, with whom I spent most of the afternoon alone.
Thence to my (yet living) godmother and kinswoman,
Mrs. Keightley, sister to Sir Thomas Evelyn and niece to
my father, being now eighty-six years of age, sprightly,
and in perfect health, her eyes serving her as well as
ever, and of a comely countenance, that one would not
suppose her above fifty.</p>
