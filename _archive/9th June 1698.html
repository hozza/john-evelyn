<p>To Deptford, to see how miserably
the Czar had left my house, after three months making
it his Court. I got Sir Christopher Wren, the King's
surveyor, and Mr. London, his gardener, to go and estimate
the repairs, for which they allowed Â£150 in their report
to the Lords of the Treasury. I then went to see the
foundation of the Hall and Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.</p>
