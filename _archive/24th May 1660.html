<p>Came to me Colonel Morley, about
procuring his pardon, now too late, seeing his error and
neglect of the counsel I gave him, by which, if he had
taken it he had certainly done the great work with the
same ease that Monk did it, who was then in Scotland,
and Morley in a post to have done what he pleased, but
his jealousy and fear kept him from that blessing and
honor. I addressed him to Lord Mordaunt, then in great
favor, for his pardon, which he obtained at the cost of
Â£1,000, as I heard. Oh, the sottish omission of this gentleman!
what did I not undergo of danger in this negotiation,
to have brought him over to his Majesty's
interest, when it was entirely in his hands!</p>
