<p>A fiery exhalation rising out of the sea,
spread itself in Montgomeryshire a furlong broad, and
many miles in length, burning all straw, hay, thatch, and
grass, but doing no harm to trees, timber, or any solid
things, only firing barns, or thatched houses. It left such
a taint on the grass as to kill all the cattle that eat of
it. I saw the attestations in the hands of the sufferers.
It lasted many months. "The Berkeley Castle" sunk by
the French coming from the East Indies, worth £200,000.
The French took our castle of Gamboo in Guinea, so that
the Africa Actions fell to £30, and the India to £80.
Some regiments of Highland Dragoons were on their
march through England; they were of large stature, well
appointed and disciplined. One of them having reproached
a Dutchman for cowardice in our late fight, was attacked
by two Dutchmen, when with his sword he struck off the
head of one, and cleft the skull of the other down to his
chin.</p>

<p>A very young gentleman named Wilson, the younger
son of one who had not above £200 a year estate, lived
in the garb and equipage of the richest nobleman, for
house, furniture, coaches, saddle horses, and kept a table,
and all things accordingly, redeemed his father's estate,
and gave portions to his sisters, being challenged by one
Laws, a Scotchman, was killed in a duel, not fairly. The
quarrel arose from his taking away his own sister from
lodging in a house where this Laws had a mistress, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
the mistress of the house thinking a disparagement to it,
and losing by it, instigated Laws to this duel. He was
taken and condemned for murder. The mystery is how
this so young a gentleman, very sober and of good fame,
could live in such an expensive manner; it could not be
discovered by all possible industry, or entreaty of his
friends to make him reveal it. It did not appear that he
was kept by women, play, coining, padding, or dealing in
chemistry; but he would sometimes say that if he should live
ever so long, he had wherewith to maintain himself in
the same manner. He was very civil and well-natured,
but of no great force of understanding. This was a subject
of much discourse.</p>
