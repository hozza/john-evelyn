<p>I heard the famous singer, Cifaccio,
esteemed the best in Europe. Indeed, his holding out and
delicateness in extending and loosing a note with incomparable
softness and sweetness, was admirable; for the
rest I found him a mere wanton, effeminate child, very
coy, and proudly conceited, to my apprehension. He
touched the harpsichord to his voice rarely well. This
was before a select number of particular persons whom
Mr. Pepys invited to his house; and this was obtained by
particular favor and much difficulty, the Signor much
disdaining to show his talent to any but princes.</p>
