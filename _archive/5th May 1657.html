<p>I went with my cousin, George Tuke,
to see Baynard, in Surrey, a house of my brother Richard's,
which he would have hired. This is a very fair,
noble residence, built in a park, and having one of the
goodliest avenues of oaks up to it that ever I saw: there
is a pond of 60 acres near it; the windows of the chief
rooms are of very fine painted glass. The situation is
excessively dirty and melancholy.</p>
