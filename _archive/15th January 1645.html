<p>The zitelle, or young wenches,
which are to have portions given them by the Pope, being
poor, and to marry them, walked in procession to St.
Peter's, where the Veronica was shown.</p>

<p>I went to the Ghetto, where the Jews dwell as in a
suburb by themselves; being invited by a Jew of my
acquaintance to see a circumcision. I passed by the
Piazza Judea, where their seraglio begins; for, being
environed with walls, they are locked up every night.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
In this place remains yet part of a stately fabric, which
my Jew told me had been a palace of theirs for the
ambassador of their nation, when their country was subject
to the Romans. Being led through the Synagogue
into a private house, I found a world of people in a
chamber: by and by came an old man, who prepared
and laid in order divers instruments brought by a little
child of about seven years old in a box. These the man
laid in a silver basin; the knife was much like a short
razor to shut into the half. Then they burnt some incense
in a censer, which perfumed the room all the
while the ceremony was performing. In the basin was
a little cap made of white paper like a capuchin's hood,
not bigger than the finger: also a paper of a red astringent
powder, I suppose of bole; a small instrument of
silver, cleft in the middle at one end, to take up the
prepuce withal; a fine linen cloth wrapped up. These
being all in order, the women brought the infant
swaddled, out of another chamber, and delivered it to
the Rabbi, who carried and presented it before an altar,
or cupboard, dressed up, on which lay the five Books of
Moses, and the Commandments, a little unrolled. Before
this, with profound reverence, and mumbling a few
words, he waved the child to and fro awhile; then he
delivered it to another Rabbi, who sat all this time
upon a table. While the ceremony was performing, all
the company fell singing a Hebrew hymn, in a barbarous
tone, waving themselves to and fro; a ceremony they
observe in all their devotions.â€”The Jews in Rome all
wear yellow hats, live only upon brokage and usury,
very poor and despicable, beyond what they are in other
territories of Princes where they are permitted.</p>
