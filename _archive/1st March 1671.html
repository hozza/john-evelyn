<p>I caused Mr. Gibbon to bring to
Whitehall his excellent piece of carving, where being
come, I advertised his Majesty, who asked me where it
was; I told him in Sir Richard Browne's (my father-in-law)
chamber, and that if it pleased his Majesty to appoint
whither it should be brought, being large and
though of wood, heavy, I would take care for it. "No,"
says the King, "show me the way, I'll go to Sir Richard's
chamber," which he immediately did, walking along
the entries after me; as far as the ewry, till he came up
into the room, where I also lay. No sooner was he entered
and cast his eyes on the work, but he was astonished
at the curiosity of it; and having considered it a
long time, and discoursed with Mr. Gibbon, whom I
brought to kiss his hand, he commanded it should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
immediately carried to the Queen's side to show her. It
was carried up into her bedchamber, where she and the
King looked on and admired it again; the King, being
called away, left us with the Queen, believing she would
have bought it, it being a crucifix; but, when his Majesty
was gone, a French peddling woman, one Madame de
Boord, who used to bring petticoats and fans, and baubles,
out of France to the ladies, began to find fault with several
things in the work, which she understood no more
than an ass, or a monkey, so as in a kind of indignation,
I caused the person who brought it to carry it back to
the chamber, finding the Queen so much governed by
an ignorant Frenchwoman, and this incomparable artist
had his labor only for his pains, which not a little displeased
me; and he was fain to send it down to his cottage
again; he not long after sold it for £80, though
well worth £100, without the frame, to Sir George
Viner.</p>

<p>His Majesty's Surveyor, Mr. Wren, faithfully promised
me to employ him.<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24_24">24</a> I having also bespoke his Majesty
for his work at Windsor, which my friend, Mr. May, the
architect there, was going to alter, and repair universally;
for, on the next day, I had a fair opportunity of
talking to his Majesty about it, in the lobby next the
Queen's side, where I presented him with some sheets of
my history. I thence walked with him through St.
James's Park to the garden, where I both saw and heard
a very familiar discourse between ... and Mrs.
Nelly,<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25_25">25</a> as they called an impudent comedian, she looking
out of her garden on a terrace at the top of the wall,
and ... standing on the green walk under it. I was
heartily sorry at this scene. Thence the King walked to
the Duchess of Cleveland, another lady of pleasure, and
curse of our nation.</p>
