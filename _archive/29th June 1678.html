<p>Returned with my Lord by Hounslow
Heath, where we saw the newly raised army encamped,
designed against France, in pretense, at least; but which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
gave umbrage to the Parliament. His Majesty and a
world of company were in the field, and the whole army
in battalia; a very glorious sight. Now were brought
into service a new sort of soldiers, called <span class="smcap">Grenadiers</span>,
who were dexterous in flinging hand grenades, everyone
having a pouch full; they had furred caps with coped
crowns like Janizaries, which made them look very fierce,
and some had long hoods hanging down behind, as we
picture fools. Their clothing being likewise piebald, yellow
and red.</p>
