<p>To Court. It being the first time
his Majesty put himself solemnly into the Eastern
fashion of vest, changing doublet, stiff collar, bands and
cloak, into a comely dress, after the Persian mode, with
girdles or straps, and shoestrings and garters into buckles,
of which some were set with precious stones<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6_6">6</a> resolving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
never to alter it, and to leave the French mode, which had
hitherto obtained to our great expense and reproach.
Upon which, divers courtiers and gentlemen gave his
Majesty gold by way of wager that he would not persist
in this resolution. I had sometime before presented an
invective against that unconstancy, and our so much
affecting the French fashion, to his Majesty; in which I
took occasion to describe the comeliness and usefulness of
the Persian clothing, in the very same manner his Majesty
now clad himself. This pamphlet I entitled "<i>Tyrannus, or
the Mode</i>," and gave it to the King to read. I do not impute
to this discourse the change which soon happened,
but it was an identity that I could not but take
notice of.</p>

<p>This night was acted my Lord Broghill's tragedy, called
"<i>Mustapha</i>," before their Majesties at Court, at which I was
present; very seldom going to the public theatres for many
reasons now, as they were abused to an atheistical liberty;
foul and indecent women now (and never till now) permitted
to appear and act, who inflaming several young
noblemen and gallants, became their misses, and to some,
their wives. Witness the Earl of Oxford, Sir R.Â Howard,
Prince Rupert, the Earl of Dorset, and another greater
person than any of them, who fell into their snares, to
the reproach of their noble families, and ruin of both body
and soul.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7_7">7</a> I was invited by my Lord Chamberlain to see
this tragedy, exceedingly well written, though in my mind
I did not approve of any such pastime in a time of such
judgments and calamities.</p>
