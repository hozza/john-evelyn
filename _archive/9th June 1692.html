<p>I went to Windsor to carry my grandson
to Eton School, where I met my Lady Stonehouse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
and other of my daughter-in-law's relations, who came on
purpose to see her before her journey into Ireland. We
went to see the castle, which we found furnished and
very neatly kept, as formerly, only that the arms in the
guard chamber and keep were removed and carried away.
An exceeding great storm of wind and rain, in some
places stripping the trees of their fruit and leaves as if
it had been winter; and an extraordinary wet season,
with great floods.</p>
