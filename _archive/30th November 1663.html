<p>Was the first anniversary of our
Society for the choice of new officers, according to the
tenor of our patent and institution. It being St. Andrew's
day, who was our patron, each fellow wore a St.
Andrew's cross of ribbon on the crown of his hat. After
the election we dined together, his Majesty sending us
venison.</p>
