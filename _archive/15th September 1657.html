<p>Going to London with some
company, we stepped in to see a famous rope-dancer, called
<span style="font-size:.8em;">THE TURK</span>. I saw even to astonishment the agility with
which he performed. He walked barefooted, taking hold by
his toes only of a rope almost perpendicular, and without so
much as touching it with his hands; he danced blind-fold
on the high rope, and with a boy of twelve years
old tied to one of his feet about twenty feet beneath
him, dangling as he danced, yet he moved as nimbly as
if it had been but a feather. Lastly, he stood on his
head, on the top of a very high mast, danced on a small
rope that was very slack, and finally flew down the perpendicular,
on his breast, his head foremost, his legs and
arms extended, with divers other activities.â€”I saw the
hairy woman, twenty years old, whom I had before seen
when a child. She was born at Augsburg, in Germany.
Her very eyebrows were combed upward, and all her
<i>forehead</i> as thick and even as grows on any woman's
head, neatly dressed; a very long lock of hair out of each
ear; she had also a most prolix beard, and <i>moustachios</i>,
with long locks growing on the middle of her nose, like
an Iceland dog exactly, the color of a bright brown, fine
as well-dressed flax. She was now married, and told me
she had one child that was not hairy, nor were any of
her parents, or relations. She was very well shaped,
and played well on the harpsichord.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>
