<p>Dr. Patrick, Dean of Peterborough,
preached at Whitehall, before the Princess of Denmark,
who, since his Majesty came to the Crown,
always sat in the King's closet, and had the same
bowings and ceremonies applied to the place where
she was, as his Majesty had when there in person.</p>

<p>Dining at Mr. Pepys's, Dr. Slayer showed us an experiment
of a wonderful nature, pouring first a very cold
liquor into a glass, and superfusing on it another, to appearance
cold and clear liquor also; it first produced a
white cloud, then boiling, divers coruscations and actual
flames of fire mingled with the liquor, which being a little
shaken together, fixed divers suns and stars of real
fire, perfectly globular, on the sides of the glass, and
which there stuck like so many constellations, burning
most vehemently, and resembling stars and heavenly
bodies, and that for a long space. It seemed to exhibit
a theory of the eduction of light out of the chaos, and
the fixing or gathering of the universal light into luminous
bodies. This matter, or phosphorus, was made
out of human blood and urine, elucidating the vital
flame, or heat in animal bodies. A very noble experiment!</p>
