<p>I took a journey into the Northern
parts, riding through Oakham, a pretty town in Rutlandshire,
famous for the tenure of the Barons (Ferrers),
who hold it by taking off a shoe from every nobleman's
horse that passes with his lord through the street, unless
redeemed with a certain piece of money. In token of
this, are several gilded shoes nailed up on the castle
gate, which seems to have been large and fair. Hence,
we went by Brook, a very sweet seat and park of the
old Lady Camden's. Next, by Burleigh House, belonging
to the Duke of Buckingham, and worthily reckoned
among the noblest seats in England, situate on the brow
of a hill, built <i>à la moderne</i> near a park walled in, and
a fine wood at the descent.</p>

<p>Now we were come to Cottsmore, a pretty seat belonging
to Mr. Heath, son of the late Lord Chief Justice
of that name. Here, after dinner, parting with
the company that conducted us thus far, I passed that
evening by Belvoir Castle, built on a round mount at
the point of a long ridge of hills, which affords a
stately prospect, and is famous for its strenuous resistance
in the late civil war.</p>

<p>Went by Newark-on-Trent, a brave town and garrison.
Next, by Wharton House, belonging to the Lord
Chaworth, a handsome seat; then by Home, a noble
place belonging to the Marquis of Dorchester, and
passed the famous river Trent, which divides the South
from the North of England; and so lay that night at
Nottingham.</p>

<p>This whole town and county seems to be but one
entire rock, as it were, an exceedingly pleasant shire, full
of gentry. Here, I observed divers to live in the rocks
and caves, much after the manner as about Tours, in
France. The church is well built on an eminence;
there is a fair house of the Lord Clare's, another of
Pierrepont's; an ample market place; large streets, full
of crosses; the relics of an ancient castle, hollowed
beneath which are many caverns, especially that of the
Scots' King, and his work while there.</p>

<p>This place is remarkable for being the place where
his Majesty first erected his standard at the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
of our late unhappy differences. The prospects from
this city toward the river and meadows are most delightful.</p>
