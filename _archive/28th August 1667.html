<p>I dined with my late Lord Chancellor,
where also dined Mr. Ashburnham, and Mr. W.Â Legge, of the bedchamber; his Lordship pretty well in
heart, though now many of his friends and sycophants
abandoned him.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, to the Lords Commissioners for money,
and thence to the audience of a Russian Envoy in the
Queen's presence-chamber, introduced with much state,
the soldiers, pensioners, and guards in their order. His
letters of credence brought by his secretary in a scarf
of sarsenet, their vests sumptuous, much embroidered with
pearls. He delivered his speech in the Russ language,
but without the least action, or motion, of his body, which
was immediately interpreted aloud by a German that spoke
good English: half of it consisted in repetition of the
Czar's titles, which were very haughty and oriental: the
substance of the rest was, that he was only sent to see the
King and Queen, and know how they did, with much compliment
and frothy language. Then, they kissed their
Majesties' hands, and went as they came; but their real
errand was to get money.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
