<p>I went to Beddington, the ancient
seat of the Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure,
capacious, and in form of the buildings of the age
of Henry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth, and proper for the
old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the
first orange trees<a id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_92_92">92</a> that had been seen in England,
planted in the open ground, and secured in winter
only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
and laden with fruit, were now in decay, as well as the
grotto, fountains, cabinets, and other curiosities in the
house and abroad, it being now fallen to a child under
age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation. The estate and park about it also in decay.</p>
