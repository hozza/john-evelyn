<p>After the Popish Plot, there was now
a new and (as they called it) a Protestant Plot discovered,
that certain Lords and others should design the assassination
of the King and the Duke as they were to come
from Newmarket, with a general rising of the nation, and
especially of the city of London, disaffected to the present
Government. Upon which were committed to the
Tower, the Lord Russell, eldest son of the Earl of Bedford,
the Earl of Essex, Mr. Algernon Sidney, son to the
old Earl of Leicester, Mr. Trenchard, Hampden, Lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Howard of Escrick, and others. A proclamation was issued
against my Lord Grey, the Duke of Monmouth, Sir
Thomas Armstrong, and one Ferguson, who had escaped
beyond sea; of these some were said to be for killing the
King, others for only seizing on him, and persuading him
to new counsels, on the pretense of the danger of Popery,
should the Duke live to succeed, who was now again admitted
to the councils and cabinet secrets. The Lords
Essex and Russell were much deplored, for believing
they had any evil intention against the King, or the
Church; some thought they were cunningly drawn in by
their enemies for not approving some late counsels and
management relating to France, to Popery, to the persecution
of the Dissenters, etc. They were discovered by
the Lord Howard of Escrick and some false brethren of
the club, and the design happily broken; had it taken
effect, it would, to all appearance, have exposed the
Government to unknown and dangerous events; which
God avert!</p>

<p>Was born my granddaughter at Sayes Court, and christened
by the name of Martha Maria, our Vicar officiating.
I pray God bless her, and may she choose the better
part!</p>
