<p>Dr. Allestree preached before the
household on St. Luke xi. 2; Dr. Lloyd on Matt. xxiii.
20, before the King, showing with how little reason the
Papists applied those words of our blessed Savior to
maintain the pretended infallibility they boast of. I
never heard a more Christian and excellent discourse;
yet were some offended that he seemed to say the Church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of Rome was a true church; but it was a captious mistake;
for he never affirmed anything that could be more to
their reproach, and that such was the present Church of
Rome, showing how much it had erred. There was not
in this sermon so much as a shadow for censure, no
person of all the clergy having testified greater zeal
against the errors of the Papists than this pious and
most learned person. I dined at the Bishop of Rochester's,
and then went to St. Paul's to hear that great wit,
Dr. Sprat, now newly succeeding Dr. Outram, in the
cure of St. Margaret's. His talent was a great memory,
never making use of notes, a readiness of expression in a
most pure and plain style of words, full of matter, easily
delivered.</p>
