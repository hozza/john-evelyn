<p>Accompanied by a most courteous
marchand, called Tomson, we went to view the rarities.
The city is built in the hollow or bosom of a mountain,
whose ascent is very steep, high, and rocky, so that,
from the Lantern and Mole to the hill, it represents the
shape of a theater; the streets and buildings so ranged
one above another, as our seats are in the playhouses;
but, from their materials, beauty, and structure, never
was an artificial scene more beautiful to the eye, nor is
any place, for the size of it, so full of well-designed and
stately palaces, as may be easily concluded by that rare
book in a large folio which the great virtuoso and painter,
Paul Rubens, has published, though it contains [the description
of] only one street and two or three churches.</p>

<p>The first palace we went to visit was that of Hieronymo
del Negros, to which we passed by boat across the har<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>bor.
Here I could not but observe the sudden and devilish
passion of a seaman, who plying us was intercepted
by another fellow, that interposed his boat before him
and took us in; for the tears gushing out of his eyes, he
put his finger in his mouth and almost bit it off by the
joint, showing it to his antagonist as an assurance to him
of some bloody revenge, if ever he came near that part
of the harbor again. Indeed this beautiful city is more
stained with such horrid acts of revenge and murders,
than any one place in Europe, or haply in the world,
where there is a political government, which makes it
unsafe to strangers. It is made a galley matter to carry a
knife whose point is not broken off.</p>

<p>This palace of Negros is richly furnished with the rarest
pictures; on the terrace, or hilly garden, there is a grove
of stately trees, among which are sheep, shepherds, and
wild beasts, cut very artificially in a gray stone; fountains,
rocks, and fish ponds; casting your eyes one way,
you would imagine yourself in a wilderness and silent
country; sideways, in the heart of a great city; and backward,
in the midst of the sea. All this is within one
acre of ground. In the house, I noticed those red-plaster
floors which are made so hard, and kept so polished, that
for some time one would take them for whole pieces of
porphyry. I have frequently wondered that we never
practiced this [art] in England for cabinets and rooms of
state, for it appears to me beyond any invention of that
kind; but by their carefully covering them with canvass
and fine mattresses, where there is much passage, I
suppose they are not lasting there in glory, and haply
they are often repaired.</p>

<p>There are numerous other palaces of particular curiosities,
for the marchands being very rich, have, like our
neighbors, the Hollanders, little or no extent of ground
to employ their estates in; as those in pictures and hangings,
so these lay it out on marble houses and rich furniture.
One of the greatest here for circuit is that of the
Prince Doria, which reaches from the sea to the summit
of the mountains. The house is most magnificently built
without, nor less gloriously furnished within, having whole
tables and bedsteads of massy silver, many of them set
with agates, onyxes, cornelians, lazulis, pearls, torquoises,
and other precious stones. The pictures and statues are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
innumerable. To this palace belong three gardens, the
first whereof is beautified with a terrace, supported by
pillars of marble; there is a fountain of eagles, and one
of Neptune, with other sea-gods, all of the purest white
marble; they stand in a most ample basin of the same
stone. At the side of this garden is such an aviary as
Sir Francis Bacon describes in his "<i>Sermones Fidelium</i>," or
"Essays," wherein grow trees of more than two feet diameter,
besides cypress, myrtles, lentiscuses, and other rare
shrubs, which serve to nestle and perch all sorts of birds,
who have air and place enough under their airy canopy,
supported with huge iron work, stupendous for its fabric
and the charge. The other two gardens are full of orange
trees, citrons, and pomegranates, fountains, grots, and
statues. One of the latter is a colossal Jupiter, under
which is the sepulchre of a beloved dog, for the care of
which one of this family received of the King of Spain
500 crowns a year, during the life of that faithful animal.
The reservoir of water here is a most admirable piece of
art; and so is the grotto over against it.</p>

<p>We went hence to the Palace of the Dukes, where is
also the Court of Justice; thence to the Merchant's Walk,
rarely covered. Near the Ducal Palace we saw the public
armory, which was almost all new, most neatly kept
and ordered, sufficient for 30,000 men. We were showed
many rare inventions and engines of war peculiar to that
armory, as in the state when guns were first put in use.
The garrison of the town chiefly consists of Germans and
Corsicans. The famous Strada Nova, built wholly of
polished marble, was designed by Rubens, and for stateliness
of the buildings, paving, and evenness of the street,
is far superior to any in Europe, for the number of
houses; that of Don Carlo Doria is a most magnificent
structure. In the gardens of the old Marquis Spinola,
I saw huge citrons hanging on the trees, applied like
our apricots to the walls. The churches are no less splendid
than the palaces; that of St. Francis is wholly built of
Parian marble; St. Laurence, in the middle of the city,
of white and black polished stone, the inside wholly incrusted
with marble and other precious materials; on the
altar of St. John stand four sumptuous columns of porphyry;
and here we were showed an emerald, supposed
to be one of the largest in the world. The church of St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Ambrosio, belonging to the Jesuits, will, when finished,
exceed all the rest; and that of the Annunciada, founded
at the charges of one family, in the present and future
design can never be outdone for cost and art. From
the churches we walked to the Mole, a work of solid huge
stone, stretching itself near 600 paces into the main sea,
and secures the harbor, heretofore of no safety. Of all
the wonders of Italy, for the art and nature of the design,
nothing parallels this. We passed over to the Pharos,
or Lantern, a tower of very great height. Here we
took horses, and made the circuit of the city as far as
the new walls, built of a prodigious height, and with
Herculean industry; witness those vast pieces of whole
mountains which they have hewn away, and blown up
with gunpowder, to render them steep and inaccessible.
They are not much less than twenty English miles in extent,
reaching beyond the utmost buildings of the city.
From one of these promontories we could easily discern
the island of Corsica; and from the same, eastward, we
saw a vale having a great torrent running through a most
desolate barren country; and then turning our eyes more
northward, saw those delicious villas of St. Pietro d'Arena,
which present another Genoa to you, the ravishing
retirements of the Genoese nobility. Hence, with much
pain, we descended toward the Arsenal, where the galleys
lie in excellent order.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the city are much affected to the
Spanish mode and stately garb. From the narrowness
of the streets, they use sedans and litters, and not coaches.</p>
