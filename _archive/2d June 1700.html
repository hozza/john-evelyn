<p>A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing
showers.</p>

<p>9th-16th June, 1700. In the afternoon, our clergy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>man
had a catechism, which was continued for some
time.</p>

<p>July, 1700. I was visited with illness, but it pleased
God that I recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him
by me, and that he has again so graciously advertised
me of my duty to prepare for my latter end, which at
my great age, cannot be far off.</p>

<p>The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of
Denmark, died of the smallpox.</p>
