<p>This afternoon came Monsieur Querouaille
and his lady, parents to the famous beauty and
... favorite at Court, to see Sir R.Â Browne, with
whom they were intimately acquainted in Bretagne, at
the time Sir Richard was sent to Brest to supervise his
Majesty's sea affairs, during the latter part of the King's
banishment. This gentleman's house was not a mile
from Brest; Sir Richard made an acquaintance there,
and, being used very civilly, was obliged to return it
here, which we did. He seemed a soldierly person and
a good fellow, as the Bretons generally are; his lady had
been very handsome, and seemed a shrewd understanding
woman. Conversing with him in our garden, I found
several words of the Breton language the same with our
Welsh. His daughter was now made Duchess of Portsmouth,
and in the height of favor; but he never made
any use of it.</p>
