<p>Was my Lord Mayor's show, with
a number of sumptuous pageants, speeches, and verses. I
was standing in a house in Cheapside against the place
prepared for their Majesties. The Prince and heir of
Denmark was there, but not our King. There were also
the maids of honor. I went to Court this evening, and
had much discourse with Dr. Basiers, one of his Majesty's
chaplains, the great traveler, who showed me the syngraphs
and original subscriptions of divers eastern patriarchs
and Asian churches to our confession.</p>
