<p>I went to Kew to visit Sir Henry
Capell, brother to the late Earl of Essex; but he being
gone to Cashiobury, after I had seen his garden and the
alterations therein, I returned home. He had repaired his
house, roofed his hall with a kind of cupola, and in a niche
was an artificial fountain; but the room seems to me over-melancholy,
yet might be much improved by having the
walls well painted <i>รก fresco</i>. The two green houses for
oranges and myrtles, communicating with the rooms below,
are very well contrived. There is a cupola made with
pole-work between two elms at the end of a walk, which
being covered by plashing the trees to them, is very
pretty; for the rest there are too many fir trees in the
garden.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>
