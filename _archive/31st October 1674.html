<p>My birthday, 54th year of my life.
Blessed be God! It was also preparation day for the Holy
Sacrament, in which I participated the next day, imploring
God's protection for the year following, and confirming my
resolutions of a more holy life, even upon the Holy Book.
The Lord assist and be gracious unto me! Amen.</p>
