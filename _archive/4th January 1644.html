<p>I passed this day with one Mr.Â J.
Wall, an Irish gentleman, who had been a friar in Spain,
and afterward a reader in St. Isodore's chair, at Rome;
but was, I know not how, getting away, and pretending
to be a soldier of fortune, an absolute cavalier, having,
as he told us, been a captain of horse in Germany. It
is certain he was an excellent disputant, and so
strangely given to it that nothing could pass him. He
would needs persuade me to go with him this morning
to the Jesuits' College, to witness his polemical talent.
We found the Fathers in their Church at the Rue St.
Antoine, where one of them showed us that noble fabric,
which for its cupola, pavings, incrustations of marble,
the pulpit, altars (especially the high altar), organ,
lavatorium, etc., but above all, for the richly carved and
incomparable front I esteem to be one of the most perfect
pieces of architecture in Europe, emulating even
some of the greatest now at Rome itself. But this not
being what our friar sought, he led us into the adjoining
convent, where, having shown us the library, they
began a very hot dispute on some points of divinity,
which our cavalier contested only to show his pride, and
to that indiscreet height, that the Jesuits would hardly
bring us to our coach, they being put beside all patience.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
The next day, we went into the University, and into the
College of Navarre, which is a spacious, well-built quadrangle,
having a very noble library.</p>

<p>Thence to the Sorbonne, an ancient fabric built by one
Robert de Sorbonne, whose name it retains, but the restoration
which the late Cardinal de Richelieu has made
to it renders it one of the most excellent modern buildings;
the sumptuous church, of admirable architecture, is
far superior to the rest. The cupola, portico, and whole
design of the church, are very magnificent.</p>

<p>We entered into some of the schools, and in that of
divinity we found a grave Doctor in his chair, with a
multitude of auditors, who all write as he dictates; and
this they call a Course. After we had sat a little, our
cavalier started up, and rudely enough began to dispute
with the doctor; at which, and especially as he was clad
in the Spanish habit, which in Paris is the greatest bugbear
imaginable, the scholars and doctor fell into such a
fit of laughter, that nobody could be heard speak for a
while: but silence being obtained, he began to speak
Latin, and made his apology in so good a style, that
their derision was turned to admiration; and beginning
to argue, he so baffled the Professor, that with universal
applause they all rose up, and did him great honors,
waiting on us to the very street and our coach, and testifying
great satisfaction.</p>
