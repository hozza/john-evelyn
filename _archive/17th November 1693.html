<p>Was the funeral of Captain
Young, who died of the stone and great age. I think he
was the first who in the first war with Cromwell against
Spain, took the Governor of Havanna, and another rich
prize, and struck the first stroke against the Dutch fleet
in the first war with Holland in the time of the Rebellion;
a sober man and an excellent seaman.</p>
