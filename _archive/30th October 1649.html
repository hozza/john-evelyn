<p>I was at the funeral of one Mr.
Downes, a sober English gentleman. We accompanied
his corpse to Charenton, where he was interred in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
cabbage-garden, yet with the office of our church, which
was said before in our chapel at Paris. Here I saw also
where they buried the great soldier, Gassion, who had a
tomb built over him like a fountain, the design and materials
mean enough. I returned to Paris with Sir Philip
Musgrave, and Sir Marmaduke Langdale, since Lord
Langdale.â€”Memorandum. This was a very sickly and
mortal autumn.</p>
