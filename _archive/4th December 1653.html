<p>Going this day to our church, I
was surprised to see a tradesman, a mechanic, step up;
I was resolved yet to stay and see what he would make
of it. His text was from 2 Sam. xxiii. 20: "And Benaiah
went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in
the time of snow"; the purport was, that no danger was
to be thought difficult when God called for shedding of
blood, inferring that now the saints were called to destroy
temporal governments; with such feculent stuff; so
dangerous a crisis were things grown to.</p>
