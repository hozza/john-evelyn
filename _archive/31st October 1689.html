<p>My birthday, being now sixty-nine
years old. Blessed Father, who hast prolonged my
years to this great age, and given me to see so great
and wonderful revolutions, and preserved me amid them
to this moment, accept, I beseech thee, the continuance
of my prayers and thankful acknowledgments, and grant
me grace to be working out my salvation and redeeming
the time, that thou mayst be glorified by me here,
and my immortal soul saved whenever thou shalt call
for it, to perpetuate thy praises to all eternity, in that
heavenly kingdom where there are no more changes or
vicissitudes, but rest, and peace, and joy, and consummate
felicity, forever. Grant this, O heavenly Father,
for the sake of Jesus thine only Son and our Savior.
Amen!</p>
