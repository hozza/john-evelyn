<p>The next day began the more solemn
lectures in all the faculties, which were performed in the
several schools, where all the Inceptor-Doctors did their
exercises, the Professors having first ended their reading.
The assembly now returned to the Theater, where
the <i>Terr√¶ filius</i> (the <i>University Buffoon</i>) entertained the
auditory with a tedious, abusive, sarcastical rhapsody,
most unbecoming the gravity of the University, and that
so grossly, that unless it be suppressed, it will be of ill
consequence, as I afterward plainly expressed my sense
of it both to the Vice-Chancellor and several Heads of
Houses, who were perfectly ashamed of it, and resolved
to take care of it in future. The old facetious way of
rallying upon the questions was left off, falling wholly
upon persons, so that it was rather licentious lying and
railing than genuine and noble wit. In my life, I was
never witness of so shameful an entertainment.</p>

<p>After this ribaldry, the Proctors made their speeches.
Then began the music art, vocal and instrumental, above
in the balustrade corridor opposite to the Vice-Chancellor's
seat. Then Dr. Wallis, the mathematical Professor,
made his oration, and created one Doctor of music according
to the usual ceremonies of gown (which was of
white damask), cap, ring, kiss, etc. Next followed the
disputations of the Inceptor-Doctors in Medicine, the
speech of their Professor, Dr. Hyde, and so in course
their respective creations. Then disputed the Inceptors of
Law, the speech of their Professor, and creation. Lastly,
Inceptors of Theology: Dr. Compton (brother of the Earl
of Northampton) being junior, began with great modesty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and applause; so the rest. After which, Dr. Tillotson,
Dr. Sprat, etc., and then Dr. Allestree's speech, the
King's Professor, and their respective creations. Last of
all, the Vice-Chancellor, shutting up the whole in a panegyrical
oration, celebrating their benefactor and the rest,
apposite to the occasion.</p>

<p>Thus was the Theater dedicated by the scholastic exercises
in all the Faculties with great solemnity; and the
night, as the former, entertaining the new Doctor's
friends in feasting and music. I was invited by Dr.
Barlow, the worthy and learned Professor of Queen's
College.</p>
