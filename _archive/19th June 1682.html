<p>The Bantam, or East India Ambassadors
(at this time we had in London the Russian,
Moroccan, and Indian Ambassadors), being invited to
dine at Lord George Berkeley's (now Earl), I went to the
entertainment to contemplate the exotic guests. They
were both very hard-favored, and much resembling in
countenance some sort of monkeys. We ate at two tables,
the Ambassadors and interpreter by themselves. Their
garments were rich Indian silks, flowered with gold, viz,
a close waistcoat to their knees, drawers, naked legs, and
on their heads caps made like fruit baskets. They wore
poisoned daggers at their bosoms, the hafts carved with
some ugly serpents' or devils' heads, exceedingly keen, and
of Damascus metal. They wore no sword. The second
Ambassador (sent it seems to succeed in case the first
should die by the way in so tedious a journey), having
been at Mecca, wore a Turkish or Arab sash, a little part
of the linen hanging down behind his neck, with some
other difference of habit, and was half a negro, bare legged
and naked feet, and deemed a very holy man. They
sat cross-legged like Turks, and sometimes in the posture
of apes and monkeys; their nails and teeth as black
as jet, and shining, which being the effect, as to their
teeth, of perpetually chewing betel to preserve them from
the toothache, much raging in their country, is esteemed
beautiful.</p>

<p>The first ambassador was of an olive hue, a flat face,
narrow eyes, squat nose, and Moorish lips, no hair appeared;
they wore several rings of silver, gold and copper
on their fingers, which was a token of knighthood, or
nobility. They were of Java Major, whose princes have
been turned Mahometans not above fifty years since; the
inhabitants are still pagans and idolaters. They seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of a dull and heavy constitution, not wondering at any
thing they saw; but exceedingly astonished how our law
gave us propriety in our estates, and so thinking we were
all kings, for they could not be made to comprehend
how subjects could possess anything but at the pleasure
of their Prince, they being all slaves; they were pleased
with the notion, and admired our happiness. They were
very sober, and I believe subtle in their way. Their
meat was cooked, carried up, and they attended by
several fat slaves, who had no covering save drawers,
which appeared very uncouth and loathsome. They ate
their pilaw, and other spoon-meat, without spoons, taking
up their pottage in the hollow of their fingers, and very
dexterously flung it into their mouths without spilling
a drop.</p>
