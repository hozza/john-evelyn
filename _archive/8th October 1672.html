<p>I took leave of my Lady Sunderland,
who was going to Paris to my Lord, now ambassador
there. She made me stay to dinner at Leicester
House, and afterward sent for Richardson, the famous
fire-eater. He devoured brimstone on glowing coals before
us, chewing and swallowing them; he melted a beer-glass
and ate it quite up; then, taking a live coal on his
tongue, he put on it a raw oyster, the coal was blown
on with bellows till it flamed and sparkled in his mouth,
and so remained till the oyster gaped and was quite
boiled. Then, he melted pitch and wax with sulphur,
which he drank down as it flamed; I saw it flaming in
his mouth a good while; he also took up a thick piece
of iron, such as laundresses use to put in their smoothing
boxes, when it was fiery hot, held it between his
teeth, then in his hand, and threw it about like a stone;
but this, I observed, he cared not to hold very long; then
he stood on a small pot, and, bending his body, took a
glowing iron with his mouth from between his feet, without
touching the pot, or ground, with his hands; with
divers other prodigious feats.</p>
