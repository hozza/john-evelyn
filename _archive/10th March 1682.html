<p>This day was executed Colonel
Vrats, and some of his accomplices, for the execrable
murder of <a id="tn_png_179"></a><!--TN: Period added after "Mr"-->Mr. Thynn, set on by the principal Koningsmark.
He went to execution like an undaunted hero, as
one that had done a friendly office for that base coward,
Count Koningsmark, who had hopes to marry his widow,
the rich Lady Ogle, and was acquitted by a corrupt jury,
and so got away. Vrats told a friend of mine who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
accompanied him to the gallows, and gave him some advice
that he did not value dying of a rush, and hoped and
believed God would deal with him like a gentleman.
Never man went, so unconcerned for his sad fate.</p>
