<p>His Majesty's birthday; I was at
his rising in his bedchamber, afterward in the park, where
four companies of guards were drawn up. The officers,
etc., wonderfully rich and gallant; they did not head their
troops, but their next officers, the colonels being on horseback
by the King while they marched. The ladies not
less splendid at Court, where there was a ball at night;
but small appearance of quality. All the shops both in
the city and suburbs were shut up, and kept as solemnly
as any holiday. Bonfires at night in Westminster, but
forbidden in the city.</p>
