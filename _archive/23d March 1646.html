<p>I took my leave of the Patriarch and
the Prince of Wirtemberg, and Monsieur Grotius (son of
the learned Hugo) now going as commander to Candia;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
and, in the afternoon, received of Vandervoort, my merchant,
my bills of exchange of 300 ducats for my journey.
He showed me his rare collection of Italian books,
esteemed very curious, and of good value.</p>

<p>The next day, I was conducted to the Ghetto, where
the Jews dwell together in as a tribe or ward, where I
was present at a marriage. The bride was clad in white,
sitting in a lofty chair, and covered with a white veil;
then two old Rabbis joined them together, one of them
holding a glass of wine in his hand, which, in the midst
of the ceremony, pretending to deliver to the woman, he
let fall, the breaking whereof was to signify the
frailty of our nature, and that we must expect disasters
and crosses amid all enjoyments. This done we
had a fine banquet, and were brought into the bride-chamber,
where the bed was dressed up with flowers,
and the counterpane strewn in works. At this ceremony,
we saw divers very beautiful Portuguese Jewesses, with
whom we had some conversation.</p>

<p>I went to the Spanish Ambassador with Bonifacio, his
confessor, and obtained his pass to serve me in the Spanish
dominions; without which I was not to travel, in this
pompous form:</p>

<span class="keepright"><i>Mar. de la Fuentes, etc.</i>"</span></p>

<p>Having packed up my purchases of books, pictures, casts,
treacle, etc. (the making an extraordinary ceremony
whereof I had been curious to observe, for it is extremely
pompous and worth seeing), I departed from
Venice, accompanied with Mr. Waller (the celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
poet), now newly gotten out of England, after the Parliament
had extremely worried him for attempting to put
in execution the commission of Array, and for which
the rest of his colleagues were hanged by the rebels.</p>

<p>The next day, I took leave of my comrades at Padua,
and receiving some directions from Dr. Salvatico as to
the care of my health, I prepared for my journey toward
Milan.</p>

<p>It was Easter-Monday that I was invited to breakfast
at the Earl of Arundel's. I took my leave of him in his
bed, where I left that great and excellent man in tears
on some private discourse of crosses that had befallen
his illustrious family, particularly the undutifulness of
his grandson Philip turning Dominican Friar (since
Cardinal of Norfolk), and the misery of his country now
embroiled in civil war. He caused his gentleman to
give me directions, all written with his own hand, what
curiosities I should inquire after in my journey; and, so
enjoining me to write sometimes to him, I departed.
There stayed for me below, Mr. Henry Howard (afterward
Duke of Norfolk), Mr. J. Digby, son of Sir Kenelm
Digby, and other gentlemen, who conducted me to the
coach.</p>

<p>The famous lapidaries of Venice for false stones and
pastes, so as to emulate the best diamonds, rubies, etc.,
were Marco Terrasso and Gilbert.</p>

<p>In company, then, with Mr. Waller, one Captain Wray
(son of Sir Christopher, whose father had been in arms
against his Majesty, and therefore by no means welcome
to us), with Mr. Abdy, a modest and learned man, we
got that night to Vicenza, passing by the Euganéan hills,
celebrated for the prospects and furniture of rare simples,
which we found growing about them. The ways were
something deep, the whole country flat and even as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
bowling-green. The common fields lie square, and are
orderly planted with fruit trees, which the vines run and
embrace, for many miles, with delicious streams creeping
along the ranges.</p>

<p>Vicenza is a city in the Marquisate of Treviso, yet
appertaining to the Venetians, full of gentlemen and
splendid palaces, to which the famous Palladio, born here,
has exceedingly contributed, having been the architect.
Most conspicuous is the Hall of Justice; it has a tower
of excellent work; the lower pillars are of the first order;
those in the three upper corridors are Doric; under them,
are shops in a spacious piazza. The hall was built in
imitation of that at Padua, but of a nobler design, <i>à la
moderne</i>. The next morning, we visited the theater, as
being of that kind the most perfect now standing, and
built by Palladio, in exact imitation of the ancient
Romans, and capable of containing 5,000 spectators. The
scene, which is all of stone, represents an imperial city,
the order Corinthian, decorated with statues. Over the
Scenario is inscribed: "<i>Virtuti ac Genio Olympior: Academia
Theatrum hoc à fundamentis erexit Palladio Architect:
1584</i>." The scene declines eleven feet, the <i>soffito</i> painted
with clouds. To this there joins a spacious hall for
solemn days to ballot in, and a second for the Academics.
In the piazza is also the <i>podesta</i>, or governor's house,
the <i>facciata</i> being of the Corinthian order, very noble.
The piazza itself is so large as to be capable of jousts
and tournaments, the nobility of this city being exceedingly
addicted to this knight-errantry, and other martial
diversions. In this place are two pillars in imitation <a id="tn_png_248"></a><!--TN: Extra "of" removed-->of
those at St. Mark's at Venice, bearing one of them
a winged lion, the other the statue of St. John the Baptist.</p>

<p>In a word, this sweet town has more well-built palaces
than any of its dimensions in all Italy, besides a number
begun and not yet finished (but of stately design) by
reason of the domestic dissensions between them and those
of Brescia, fomented by the sage Venetians, lest by combining,
they might think of recovering their ancient
liberty. For this reason, also, are permitted those disorders
and insolences committed at Padua among the
youth of these two territories. It is no dishonor in this
country to be some generations in finishing their palaces,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
that without exhausting themselves by a vast expense at
once, they may at last erect a sumptuous pile. Count
Oleine's Palace is near perfected in this manner. Count
Ulmarini is more famous for his gardens, being without
the walls, especially his <i>cedrario</i>, or conserve of oranges,
eleven score of my paces long, set in order and ranges,
making a canopy all the way by their intermixing branches
for more than 200 of my single paces, and which being
full of fruit and blossoms, was a most delicious sight.
In the middle of this garden, was a cupola made of wire,
supported by slender pillars of brick, so closely covered
with ivy, both without and within, that nothing was to
be perceived but green; between the arches there dangled
festoons of the same. Here is likewise a most inextricable
labyrinth.</p>

<p>I had in this town recommendation to a very civil and
ingenious apothecary, called Angelico, who had a pretty
collection of paintings. I would fain have visited a
palace, called the Rotunda, which was a mile out of town,
belonging to Count Martio Capra; but one of our companions
hastening to be gone, and little minding anything
save drinking and folly, caused us to take coach
sooner than we should have done.</p>

<p>A little from the town, we passed the Campo Martio,
set out in imitation of ancient Rome, wherein the nobles
exercised their horses, and the ladies make the Corso; it
is entered by a stately triumphal arch, the invention of
Palladio.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VERONA</div>

<p>Being now set out for Verona, about midway we dined
at Ostaria Nova, and came late to our resting-place,
which was the Cavaletto, just over the monument of
the Scalageri,<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_36_36">36</a> formerly princes of Verona, adorned with
many devices in stone of ladders, alluding to the name.</p>

<p>Early next morning, we went about the city, which is
built on the gentle declivity, and bottom of a hill, environed
in part with some considerable mountains and
downs of fine grass, like some places in the south of
England, and, on the other side, having the rich plain
where Caius Marius overthrew the Cimbrians. The city
is divided in the midst by the river Adige, over which
are divers stately bridges, and on its banks are many
goodly palaces, whereof one is well painted in <i>chiaro-oscuro</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
on the outside, as are divers in this dry climate of
Italy.</p>

<p>The first thing that engaged our attention and wonder,
too, was the amphitheater, which is the most entire of
ancient remains now extant. The inhabitants call it the
<span class="smcap">Arena</span>: it has two porticos, one within the other, and is
thirty-four rods long, twenty-two in breadth, with forty-two
ranks of stone benches, or seats, which reach to the
top. The vastness of the marble stones is stupendous.
"<i>L. V. Flaminius, Consul. anno. urb. con. liii.</i>" This I
esteem to be one of the noblest antiquities in Europe, it
is so vast and entire, having escaped the ruins of so
many other public buildings for above 1,400 years.</p>

<p>There are other arches, as that of the victory of
Marius; temples, aqueducts, etc., showing still considerable
remains in several places of the town, and how
magnificent it has formerly been. It has three strong
castles and a large and noble wall. Indeed, the whole
city is bravely built, especially the Senate house, where
we saw those celebrated statues of Cornelius Nepos,
Æmilius Marcus, Plinius, and Vitruvius, all having honored
Verona by their birth; and, of later date, Julius
Cæsar Scaliger, that prodigy of learning.</p>

<p>In the evening we saw the garden of Count Giusti's
villa where are walks cut out of the main rock, from
whence we had a pleasant prospect of Mantua and Parma,
though at great distance. At the entrance of this garden,
grows the goodliest cypress, I fancy, in Europe, cut
in a pyramid; it is a prodigious tree both for breadth
and height, entirely covered, and thick to the base.</p>

<p>Dr. Cortone, a civilian, showed us, among other rarities,
a St. Dorothea, of Raphael. We could not see the rare
drawings, especially of Parmensis, belonging to Dr. Marcello,
another advocate, on account of his absence.</p>

<p>Verona deserved all those elogies Scaliger has honored
it with; for in my opinion, the situation is the most
delightful I ever saw, it is so sweetly mixed with rising
ground and valleys, so elegantly planted with trees on
which Bacchus seems riding as it were in triumph every
autumn, for the vines reach from tree to tree; here, of all
places I have seen in Italy, would I fix a residence.
Well has that learned man given it the name of the very
eye of the world:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>The next morning we traveled over the downs where
Marius fought and fancied ourselves about Winchester,
and the country toward Dorsetshire. We dined at an inn
called Cavalli Caschieri, near Peschiera, a very strong
fort of the Venetian Republic, and near the Lago di
Garda, which disembogues into that of Mantua, near forty
miles in length, highly spoken of by my Lord Arundel
to me, as the most pleasant spot in Italy, for which reason
I observed it with the more diligence, alighting out of
the coach, and going up to a grove of cypresses growing
about a gentleman's country-house, from whence indeed
it presents a most surprising prospect. The hills and
gentle risings about it produce oranges, citrons, olives,
figs, and other tempting fruits, and the waters abound
in excellent fish, especially trouts. In the middle of this
lake stands Sermonea, on an island; here Captain Wray
bought a pretty nag of the master of our inn where we
dined, for eight pistoles, which his wife, our hostess, was
so unwilling to part with, that she did nothing but kiss
and weep and hang about the horse's neck, till the captain
rode away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRESCIA</div>

<p>We came this evening to Brescia, which next morning
we traversed, according to our custom, in search of antiquities
and new sights. Here, I purchased of old Lazarino
Cominazzo my fine carbine, which cost me nine
pistoles, this city being famous for these firearms, and
that workman, Jo. Bap. Franco, the best esteemed. The
city consists most in artists, every shop abounding in
guns, swords, armorers, etc. Most of the workmen come
out of Germany. It stands in a fertile plain, yet the
castle is built on a hill. The streets abound in fair
fountains. The Torre della Pallada is of a noble Tuscan
order, and the Senate house is inferior to few. The piazza
is but indifferent; some of the houses arched as at
Padua. The Cathedral was under repair. We would
from hence have visited Parma, Piacenza, Mantua, etc.;
but the banditti and other dangerous parties being
abroad, committing many enormities, we were contented
with a Pisgah sight of them.</p>

<p>We dined next day, at Ursa Vecchia, and, after din<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>ner,
passed by an exceeding strong fort of the Venetians,
called Ursa Nova, on their frontier. Then by the river
Oglio, and so by Sonano, where we enter the Spanish
dominions, and that night arrived at Crema, which belongs
to Venice, and is well defended. The Podesta's Palace is
finely built, and so is the Duomo, or Cathedral, and the
tower to it, with an ample piazza.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MILAN</div>

<p>Early next day, after four miles' riding, we entered
into the State of Milan, and passed by Lodi, a great city
famous for cheese, little short of the best Parmeggiano.
We dined at Marignano, ten miles before coming to
Milan, where we met half a dozen suspicious cavaliers,
who yet did us no harm. Then, passing as through a
continual garden, we went on with exceeding pleasure;
for it is the Paradise of Lombardy, the highways as even
and straight as a line, the fields to a vast extent planted
with fruit about the inclosures, vines to every tree at
equal distances, and watered with frequent streams.
There was likewise much corn, and olives in abundance.
At approach of the city, some of our company, in dread
of the Inquisition (severer here than in all Spain),
thought of throwing away some Protestant books and
papers. We arrived about three in the afternoon, when
the officers searched us thoroughly for prohibited goods;
but, finding we were only gentlemen travelers, dismissed
us for a small reward, and we went quietly to our inn,
the <span class="smcap">Three Kings</span>, where, for that day, we refreshed ourselves,
as we had need. The next morning, we delivered
our letters of recommendation to the learned and courteous
Ferrarius, a Doctor of the Ambrosian College, who
conducted us to all the remarkable places of the town,
the first of which was the famous Cathedral. We entered
by a portico, so little inferior to that of Rome that,
when it is finished, it will be hard to say which is the
fairest; the materials are all of white and black marble,
with columns of great height, of Egyptian granite. The
outside of the church is so full of sculpture, that you may
number 4,000 statues, all of white marble, among which
that of St. Bartholomew is esteemed a masterpiece. The
church is very spacious, almost as long as St. Peter's at
Rome, but not so large. About the choir, the sacred
Story is finely sculptured, in snow-white marble, nor know
I where it is exceeded. About the body of the church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
are the miracles of St. Charles Borromeo, and in the
vault beneath is his body before the high altar, grated,
and inclosed, in one of the largest crystals in Europe.
To this also belongs a rich treasure. The cupola is all
of marble within and without, and even covered with
great planks of marble, in the Gothic design. The windows
are most beautifully painted. Here are two very
fair and excellent organs. The fabric is erected in
the midst of a fair piazza, and in the center of the
city.</p>

<p>Hence, we went to the Palace of the Archbishop, which
is a quadrangle, the architecture of Theobaldi, who designed
much for Philip II. in the Escurial, and has built
much in Milan. Hence, into the Governor's Palace, who
was Constable of Castile. Tempted by the glorious tapestries
and pictures, I adventured so far alone, that peeping
into a chamber where the great man was under the
barber's hands, he sent one of his negroes (a slave)
to know what I was. I made the best excuse I could,
and that I was only admiring the pictures, which he returning
and telling his lord, I heard the Governor reply
that I was a spy; on which I retired with all the speed
I could, passed the guard of Swiss, got into the street,
and in a moment to my company, who were gone to the
Jesuits' Church, which in truth is a noble structure, the
front especially, after the modern. After dinner, we
were conducted to St. Celso, a church of rare architecture,
built by Bramante; the carvings of the marble <i>facciata</i>
are by Annibal Fontana, whom they esteem at
Milan equal to the best of the ancients. In a room joining
to the church, is a marble Madonna, like a Colosse, of
the same sculptor's work, which they will not expose to
the air. There are two <i>sacristias</i>, in one of which is a
fine Virgin, of Leonardo da Vinci; in the other is one of
Raphael d'Urbino, a piece which all the world admires.
The Sacristan showed us a world of rich plate, jewels,
and embroidered copes, which are kept in presses.</p>

<p>Next, we went to see the Great Hospital, a quadrangular
cloister of a vast compass, a truly royal fabric, with
an annual endowment of 50,000 crowns of gold. There
is in the middle of it a cross building for the sick, and,
just under it, an altar so placed as to be seen in all
places of the Infirmary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>There are divers colleges built in this quarter, richly
provided for by the same Borromeo and his nephew, the
last Cardinal Frederico, some not yet finished, but of excellent
design.</p>

<p>In St. Eustorgio, they tell us, formerly lay the bodies
of the three Magi, since translated to Cologne in Germany;
they, however, preserve the tomb, which is a
square stone, on which is engraven a star, and, under it,
"<i>Sepulchrum trium Magorum</i>."</p>

<p>Passing by St. Laurence, we saw sixteen columns of
marble, and the ruins of a Temple of Hercules, with this
inscription yet standing:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Imp. Cæsari L. Aurelio Vero Aug. Arminiaco Medio Parthico
Maxi Tribi <a id="tn_png_254"></a><!--TN: "Poti" changed to "Pot."-->Pot.
VII. Impi IIII. Cos. III. P. P. Divi Antonini
Pij Divi Hadriani Nepoti Divi Trajani Parthici Pro-Nepoti Divi
Nervæ Abnepoti Dec. Dec.</i>"</p>

<p>We concluded this day's wandering at the Monastery of
Madonna delle Grazie, and in the refectory admired that
celebrated <i>Cœna Domini</i> of Leonardo da Vinci, which
takes up the entire wall at the end, and is the same
that the great virtuoso, Francis I., of France, was so
enamored of, that he consulted to remove the whole wall
by binding it about with ribs of iron and timber, to convey
it into France. It is indeed one of the rarest paintings
that was ever executed by Leonardo, who was long
in the service of that Prince, and so dear to him that the
King, coming to visit him in his old age and sickness, he
expired in his arms. But this incomparable piece is now
exceedingly impaired.</p>

<p>Early next morning came the learned Dr. Ferrarius to
visit us, and took us in his coach to see the Ambrosian
Library, where Cardinal Fred Borromeo has expended so
vast a sum on this building, and in furnishing with curiosities,
especially paintings and drawings of inestimable
value among painters. It is a school fit to make the
ablest artists. There are many rare things of Hans
Breugel, and among them the Four Elements. In this
room, stands the glorious [boasting] inscription of Cavaliero
Galeazzo Arconati, valuing his gift to the library of
several drawings by Da Vinci; but these we could not see,
the keeper of them being out of town, and he always
carrying the keys with him; but my Lord Marshal, who
had seen them, told me all but one book are small that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
a huge folio contained 400 leaves full of scratches of
Indians, etc. But whereas the inscription pretends that
our King Charles had offered £1,000 for them,—the truth
is, and my Lord himself told me, that it was he who
treated with Galeazzo for himself, in the name and by
permission of the King, and that the Duke of Feria, who
was then Governor, should make the bargain; but my
Lord, having seen them since, did not think them of so
much worth.</p>

<p>In the great room, where is a goodly library, on the
right hand of the door, is a small wainscot closet, furnished
with rare manuscripts. Two original letters of the
Grand Signor were shown us, sent to two Popes, one of
which was (as I remember) to Alexander VI. [Borgia], and
the other mentioning the head of the lance which pierced
our Blessed Savior's side, as a present to the Pope: I
would feign have gotten a copy of them, but could not;
I hear, however, that they are since translated into Italian,
and that therein is a most honorable mention of Christ.</p>

<p>We revisited St. Ambrose's church. The high altar is
supported by four porphyry columns, and under it lie the
remains of that holy man. Near it they showed us a pit, or
well (an obscure place it is), where they say St. Ambrose
baptized St. Augustine, and recited the <i>Te Deum</i>; for so
imports the inscription. The place is also famous for some
Councils that have been held here, and for the coronation
of divers Italian Kings and Emperors, receiving the iron
crown from the Archbishop of this see.<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_37_37">37</a> They show the
History by Josephus, written on the bark of trees. The
high altar is wonderfully rich.</p>

<p>Milan is one of the most princely cities in Europe: it has
no suburbs, but is circled with a stately wall for ten miles,
in the center of a country that seems to flow with milk
and honey. The air is excellent; the fields fruitful to
admiration, the market abounding with all sorts of provisions.
In the city are near 100 churches, 71 monasteries,
and 40,000 inhabitants; it is of a circular figure,
fortified with bastions, full of sumptuous palaces and rare
artists, especially for works in crystal, which is here cheap,
being found among the Alps. They have curious straw-work
among the nuns, even to admiration. It has a good
river, and a citadel at some small distance from the city,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
commanding it, of great strength for its works and
munitions of all kinds. It was built by Galeatius II.,
and consists of four bastions, and works at the angles and
fronts; the graff is faced with brick to a very great depth;
has two strong towers as one enters, and within is another
fort, and spacious lodgings for the soldiers, and for exercising
them. No accommodation for strength is wanting,
and all exactly uniform. They have here also all sorts of
work and tradesmen, a great magazine of arms and provisions.
The fosse is of spring water, with a mill for
grinding corn, and the ramparts vaulted underneath. Don
Juan Vasques Coronada was now Governor; the garrison
Spaniards only.</p>

<p>There is nothing better worth seeing than the collection
of Signor Septalla, a canon of St. Ambrose, famous over
Christendom for his learning and virtues. Among other
things, he showed us an Indian wood, that has the perfect
scent of civet; a flint, or pebble, that has a quantity of
water in it, which is plainly to be seen, it being clear as
agate; divers crystals that have water moving in them,
some of them having plants, leaves, and hog's bristles in
them; much amber full of insects, and divers things of
woven amianthus.</p>

<p>Milan is a sweet place, and though the streets are narrow,
they abound in rich coaches, and are full of noblesse,
who frequent the course every night. Walking a turn in
the portico before the dome, a cavaliero who passed by,
hearing some of us speaking English, looked a good while
earnestly on us, and by and by sending his servant, desiring
we would honor him the next day at dinner. We looked
on this as an odd invitation, he not speaking to us himself,
but we returned his civility with thanks, though not
fully resolved what to do, or indeed what might be the
meaning of it in this jealous place; but on inquiry, it was
told us he was a Scots Colonel, who had an honorable
command in the city, so that we agreed to go. This afternoon,
we were wholly taken up in seeing an opera represented
by some Neapolitans, performed all in excellent
music with rare scenes, in which there acted a celebrated
beauty.</p>

<p>Next morning, we went to the Colonel's, who had sent
his servant again to conduct us to his house, which we
found to be a noble palace, richly furnished. There were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
other guests, all soldiers, one of them a Scotchman, but
we could not learn one of their names. At dinner, he
excused his rudeness that he had not himself spoken to
us; telling us it was his custom, when he heard of any
English travelers (who but rarely would be known to
pass through that city for fear of the Inquisition), to invite
them to his house, where they might be free. We
had a sumptuous dinner; and the wine was so tempting,
that after some healths had gone about, and we had risen
from the table, the Colonel led us into his hall, where
there hung up divers colors, saddles, bridles, pistols, and
other arms, being trophies which he had taken with his
own hands from the enemy; among them, he would needs
bestow a pair of pistols on Captain Wray, one of our
fellow-travelers, and a good drinking gentleman, and on
me a Turkish bridle woven with silk and very curiously
embossed, with other silk trappings, to which hung a half
moon finely wrought, which he had taken from a bashaw
whom he had slain. With this glorious spoil, I rode the
rest of my journey as far as Paris, and brought it afterward
into England. He then showed us a stable of brave
horses, with his menage and cavalerizzo. Some of the
horses he caused to be brought out, which he mounted,
and performed all the motions of an excellent horseman.
When this was done, and he had alighted,—contrary to
the advice of his groom and page, who knew the nature
of the beast, and that their master was a little spirited
with wine, he would have a fiery horse that had not yet
been managed and was very ungovernable, but was otherwise
a very beautiful creature; this he mounting, the
horse, getting the reins in a full <i>carriere</i>, rose so desperately
that he fell quite back, crushing the Colonel so
forcibly against the wall of the menage, that though he
sat on him like a Centaur, yet recovering the jade on all
fours again, he desired to be taken down and so led in,
where he cast himself on a pallet; and, with infinite
lamentations, after some time we took leave of him, being
now speechless. The next morning, going to visit
him, we found before the door the canopy which they
usually carry over the host, and some with lighted tapers;
which made us suspect he was in a very sad condition, and
so indeed we found him, an Irish Friar standing by his
bedside as confessing him, or at least disguising a con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>fession,
and other ceremonies used <i>in extremis</i>; for we
afterward learned that the gentleman was a Protestant,
and had this Friar, his confidant; which was a dangerous
thing at Milan, had it been but suspected. At our entrance,
he sighed grievously, and held up his hands, but was not
able to speak. After vomiting some blood, he kindly took
us all by the hand, and made signs that he should see us
no more, which made us take our leave of him with
extreme reluctancy and affliction for the accident. This
sad disaster made us consult about our departure as soon
as we could, not knowing how we might be inquired
after, or engaged, the Inquisition being so cruelly formidable
and inevitable, on the least suspicion. The next
morning, therefore, discharging our lodgings, we agreed
for a coach to carry us to the foot of the Alps, not a little
concerned for the death of the Colonel, which we now
heard of, and who had so courteously entertained us.</p>

<p>The first day we got as far as Castellanza, by which
runs a considerable river into Lago Maggiore; here, at
dinner, were two or three Jesuits, who were very pragmatical
and inquisitive, whom we declined conversation
with as decently as we could; so we pursued our
journey through a most fruitful plain, but the weather
was wet and uncomfortable. At night, we lay at
Sesto.</p>

<p>The next morning, leaving our coach, we embarked
in a boat to carry us over the lake (being one of the
largest in Europe), and whence we could see the
towering Alps, and among them the great San Bernardo,
esteemed the highest mountain in Europe, appearing
to be some miles above the clouds. Through this
vast water, passes the river Ticinus, which discharges
itself into the Po, by which means Helvetia transports
her merchandizes into Italy, which we now begin to
leave behind us.</p>

<p>Having now sailed about two leagues, we were hauled
ashore at Arona, a strong town belonging to the Duchy
of Milan, where, being examined by the Governor, and
paying a small duty, we were dismissed. Opposite to
this fort, is Angiera, another small town, the passage
very pleasant with the prospect of the Alps covered
with pine and fir trees, and above them snow. We
passed the pretty island Isabella, about the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the lake, on which is a fair house built on a mount;
indeed, the whole island is a mount ascended by several
terraces and walks all set above with orange and
citron trees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ISOLA</div>

<p>The next we saw was Isola, and we left on our right
hand the Isle of St. Jovanni; and so sailing by another
small town built also on an island, we arrived at night
at Margazzo, an obscure village at the end of the lake,
and at the very foot of the Alps, which now rise as it
were suddenly after some hundreds of miles of the most
even country in the world, and where there is hardly a
stone to be found, as if Nature had here swept up the
rubbish of the earth in the Alps, to form and clear the
plains of Lombardy, which we had hitherto passed since
our coming from Venice. In this wretched place, I lay
on a bed stuffed with leaves, which made such a crackling
and did so prick my skin through the tick, that I
could not sleep. The next morning, I was furnished
with an ass, for we could not get horses; instead of stirrups,
we had ropes tied with a loop to put our feet in,
which supplied the place of other trappings. Thus, with
my gallant steed, bridled with my Turkish present, we
passed through a reasonably pleasant but very narrow
valley, till we came to Duomo, where we rested, and,
having showed the Spanish pass, the Governor would
press another on us, that his secretary might get a
crown. Here we exchanged our asses for mules, sure-footed
on the hills and precipices, being accustomed to
pass them. Hiring a guide, we were brought that night
through very steep, craggy, and dangerous passages to a
village called Vedra, being the last of the King of Spain's
dominions in the Duchy of Milan. We had a very infamous
wretched lodging.</p>

<p>The next morning we mounted again through strange,
horrid, and fearful crags and tracts, abounding in pine
trees, and only inhabited by bears, wolves, and wild
goats; nor could we anywhere see above a pistol shot before
us, the horizon being terminated with rocks and
mountains, whose tops, covered with snow, seemed to
touch the skies, and in many places pierced the clouds.
Some of these vast mountains were but one entire stone,
between whose clefts now and then precipitated great
cataracts of melted snow, and other waters, which made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
a terrible roaring, echoing from the rocks and cavities;
and these waters in some places breaking in the fall,
wet us as if we had passed through a mist, so as we
could neither see nor hear one another, but, trusting to
our honest mules, we jogged on our way. The narrow
bridges, in some places made only by felling huge fir trees,
and laying them athwart from mountain to mountain, over
cataracts of stupendous depth, are very dangerous, and
so are the passages and edges made by cutting away the
main rock; others in steps; and in some places we pass
between mountains that have been broken and fallen on
one another; which is very terrible, and one had need
of a sure foot and steady head to climb some of these
precipices, besides that they are harbors for bears and
wolves, who have sometimes assaulted travelers. In these
straits, we frequently alighted, now freezing in the snow,
and anon frying by the reverberation of the sun against
the cliffs as we descend lower, when we meet now and
then a few miserable cottages so built upon the declining
of the rocks, as one would expect their sliding down.
Among these, inhabit a goodly sort of people, having
monstrous gullets, or wens of flesh, growing to their
throats, some of which I have seen as big as an hundred
pound bag of silver hanging under their chins; among
the women especially, and that so ponderous, as that to
ease them, many wear linen cloth bound about their
head, and coming under the chin to support it; but <i>quis
tumidum guttur miratur in Alpibus?</i> Their drinking so
much snow water is thought to be the cause of it; the
men using more wine, are not so strumous as the women.
The truth is, they are a peculiar race of people, and
many great water drinkers here have not these prodigious
tumors; it runs, as we say, in the blood, and is a vice
in the race, and renders them so ugly, shriveled and deformed,
by its drawing the skin of the face down, that
nothing can be more frightful; to this add a strange
puffing dress, furs, and that barbarous language, being a
mixture of corrupt High German, French, and Italian.
The people are of great stature, extremely fierce and
rude, yet very honest and trusty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNT SAMPION</div>

<p>This night, through almost inaccessible heights, we
came in prospect of Mons Sempronius, now Mount Sampion,
which has on its summit a few huts and a chapel.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Approaching this, Captain Wray's water spaniel (a huge
filthy cur that had followed him out of England) hunted
a herd of goats down the rocks into a river made by the
melting of the snow. Arrived at our cold harbor (though
the house had a stove in every room) and supping on
cheese and milk with wretched wine, we went to bed in
cupboards so high from the floor, that we climbed them
by a ladder; we were covered with feathers, that is,
we lay between two ticks stuffed with them, and all little
enough to keep one warm. The ceilings of the rooms
are strangely low for those tall people. The house was
now (in September) half covered with snow, nor is there
a tree, or a bush, growing within many miles.</p>

<p>From this uncomfortable place, we prepared to hasten
away the next morning; but, as we were getting on our
mules, comes a huge young fellow demanding money for
a goat which he affirmed that Captain Wray's dog had
killed; expostulating the matter, and impatient of staying
in the cold, we set spurs and endeavored to ride away,
when a multitude of people being by this time gotten
together about us (for it being Sunday morning and attending
for the priest to say mass), they stopped our
mules, beat us off our saddles, and, disarming us of our
carbines, drew us into one of the rooms of our lodging,
and set a guard upon us. Thus we continued prisoners
till mass was ended, and then came half a score grim
Swiss, who, taking on them to be magistrates, sat down
on the table, and condemned us to pay a pistole for the
goat, and ten more for attempting to ride away, threatening
that if we did not pay it speedily, they would send
us to prison, and keep us to a day of public justice,
where, as they perhaps would have exaggerated the crime,
for they pretended we had primed our carbines and would
have shot some of them (as indeed the Captain was about
to do), we might have had our heads cut off, as we were
told afterward, for that among these rude people a very
small misdemeanor does often meet that sentence.
Though the proceedings appeared highly unjust, on consultation
among ourselves we thought it safer to rid ourselves
out of their hands, and the trouble we were brought
into; and therefore we patiently laid down the money,
and with fierce countenances had our mules and arms
delivered to us, and glad we were to escape as we did.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
This was cold entertainment, but our journey after was
colder, the rest of the way having been (as they told us)
covered with snow since the Creation; no man remembered
it to be without; and because, by the frequent
snowing, the tracks are continually filled up, we passed by
several tall masts set up to guide travelers, so as for
many miles they stand in ken of one another, like to our
beacons. In some places, where there is a cleft between
two mountains, the snow fills it up, while the bottom,
being thawed, leaves as it were a frozen arch of snow,
and that so hard as to bear the greatest weight; for as
it snows often, so it perpetually freezes, of which I was
so sensible that it flawed the very skin of my face.</p>

<p>Beginning now to descend a little, Captain Wray's
horse (that was our sumpter and carried all our baggage)
plunging through a bank of loose snow, slid down a frightful
precipice, which so incensed the choleric cavalier, his
master, that he was sending a brace of bullets into the
poor beast, lest our guide should recover him, and run
away with his burden; but, just as he was lifting up his carbine,
we gave such a shout, and so pelted the horse with
snow-balls, as with all his might plunging through the
snow, he fell from another steep place into another bottom,
near a path we were to pass. It was yet a good
while ere we got to him, but at last we recovered the
place, and, easing him of his charge, hauled him out of
the snow, where he had been certainly frozen in, if we
had not prevented it, before night. It was as we judged
almost two miles that he had slid and fallen, yet without
any other harm than the benumbing of his limbs for
the present, but, with lusty rubbing and chafing he began
to move, and, after a little walking, performed his journey
well enough. All this way, affrighted with the disaster
of this horse, we trudged on foot, driving our mules
before us; sometimes we fell, sometimes we slid, through
this ocean of snow, which after October is impassible.
Toward night, we came into a larger way, through vast
woods of pines, which clothe the middle parts of these
rocks. Here, they were burning some to make pitch and
rosin, peeling the knotty branches, as we do to make
charcoal, reserving what melts from them, which hardens
into pitch. We passed several cascades of dissolved
snow, that had made channels of formidable depth in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
crevices of the mountains, and with such a fearful roaring
as we could hear it for seven long miles. It is from
these sources that the Rhone and the Rhine, which pass
through all France and Germany, derive their originals.
Late at night, we got to a town called Briga, at the
foot of the Alps, in the Valteline. Almost every door had
nailed on the outside and next the street a bear's, wolf's,
or fox's head, and divers of them, all three; a savage
kind of sight, but, as the Alps are full of the beasts, the
people often kill them. The next morning, we returned
to our guide, and took fresh mules, and another to conduct
us to the Lake of Geneva, passing through as pleasant
a country as that we had just traveled was melancholy
and troublesome. A strange and sudden change it seemed;
for the reverberation of the sunbeams from the mountains
and rocks that like walls range it on both sides, not
above two flight-shots in breadth, for a very great number
of miles, renders the passage excessively hot.
Through such extremes we continued our journey, that
goodly river, the Rhone, gliding by us in a narrow and
quiet channel almost in the middle of this Canton, fertilizing
the country for grass and corn, which grow here
in abundance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SION</div>

<p>We arrived this night at Sion, a pretty town and city,
a bishop's seat, and the head of Valesia. There is a
castle, and the bishop who resides in it, has both civil
and ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Our host, as the custom
of these Cantons is, was one of the chiefest of the town,
and had been a Colonel in France: he treated us with
extreme civility, and was so displeased at the usage we
received at Mount Sampion, that he would needs give
us a letter to the Governor of the country, who resided
at St. Maurice, which was in our way to Geneva, to
revenge the affront. This was a true old blade, and had
been a very curious virtuoso, as we found by a handsome
collection of books, medals, pictures, shells, and
other antiquities. He showed two heads and horns of
the true capricorn, which animal he told us was frequently
killed among the mountains; one branch of them
was as much as I could well lift, and near as high as
my head, not much unlike the greater sort of goat's,
save that they bent forward, by help whereof they climb
up and hang on inaccessible rocks, from whence the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
inhabitants now and then shoot them. They speak prodigious
things of their leaping from crag to crag, and of
their sure footing, notwithstanding their being cloven-footed,
unapt (one would think) to take hold and walk
so steadily on those horrible ridges as they do. The
Colonel would have given me one of these beams, but the
want of a convenience to carry it along with me, caused me
to refuse his courtesy. He told me that in the castle
there were some Roman and Christian antiquities, and
he had some inscriptions in his own garden. He invited
us to his country-house, where he said he had better
pictures, and other rarities; but, our time being short, I
could not persuade my companions to stay and visit the
places he would have had us see, nor the offer he made
to show us the hunting of the bear, wolf, and other
wild beasts. The next morning, having presented his
daughter, a pretty well-fashioned young woman, with a
small ruby ring, we parted somewhat late from our
generous host.</p>

<p>Passing through the same pleasant valley between the
horrid mountains on either hand, like a gallery many
miles in length, we got to Martigni, where also
we were well entertained. The houses in this country
are all built of fir boards, planed within, low, and seldom
above one story. The people very clownish and rusticly
clad, after a very odd fashion, for the most part in blue
cloth, very whole and warm, with little variety of distinction
between the gentleman and common sort, by a
law of their country being exceedingly frugal. Add to
this their great honesty and fidelity, though exacting
enough for what they part with: I saw not one beggar.
We paid the value of twenty shillings English, for a
day's hire of one horse. Every man goes with a sword
by his side, the whole country well disciplined, and
indeed impregnable, which made the Romans have such
ill success against them; one lusty Swiss at their narrow
passages is sufficient to repel a legion. It is a
frequent thing here for a young tradesman, or farmer,
to leave his wife and children for twelve or fifteen years,
and seek his fortune in the wars in Spain, France,
Italy, or Germany, and then return again to work. I
look upon this country to be the safest spot of all Europe,
neither envied nor envying; nor are any of them rich,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
nor poor; they live in great simplicity and tranquillity;
and, though of the fourteen Cantons half be Roman
Catholics, the rest reformed, yet they mutually agree,
and are confederate with Geneva, and are its only
security against its potent neighbors, as they themselves
are from being attacked by the greater potentates, by
the mutual jealousy of their neighbors, as either of
them would be overbalanced, should the Swiss, who are
wholly mercenary and auxiliaries, be subjected to France
or Spain.</p>


<p>We were now arrived at St. Maurice, a large handsome
town and residence of the President, where justice is
done. To him we presented our letter from Sion, and
made known the ill usage we had received for killing a
wretched goat, which so incensed him, that he swore if we
would stay he would not only help us to recover our
money again, but most severely punish the whole rabble;
but our desire of revenge had by this time subsided, and
glad we were to be gotten so near France, which we reckoned
as good as home. He courteously invited us to dine
with him; but we excused ourselves, and, returning to
our inn, while we were eating something before we took
horse, the Governor had caused two pages to bring us a
present of two great vessels of covered plate full of excellent
wine, in which we drank his health, and rewarded
the youths; they were two vast bowls supported by two
Swiss, handsomely wrought after the German manner.
This civility and that of our host at Sion, perfectly reconciled
us to the highlanders; and so, proceeding on our
journey we passed this afternoon through the gate which
divides the Valais from the Duchy of Savoy, into which
we were now entering, and so, through Montei, we arrived
that evening at <span class="sidenote">BEVERETTA</span>Beveretta. Being extremely weary and
complaining of my head, and finding little accommodation
in the house, I caused one of our hostess's daughters to
be removed out of her bed and went immediately into it
while it was yet warm, being so heavy with pain and
drowsiness that I would not stay to have the sheets
changed; but I shortly after paid dearly for my impatience,
falling sick of the smallpox as soon as I came to <span class="sidenote">GENEVA</span>Geneva,
for by the smell of frankincense and the tale the good
woman told me of her daughter having had an ague, I
afterward concluded she had been newly recovered of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
smallpox. Notwithstanding this, I went with my company,
the next day, hiring a bark to carry us over the
lake; and indeed, sick as I was, the weather was so serene
and bright, the water so calm, and air so temperate, that
never had travelers a sweeter passage. Thus, we sailed
the whole length of the lake, about thirty miles, the
countries bordering on it (Savoy and Berne) affording one
of the most delightful prospects in the world, the Alps
covered with snow, though at a great distance, yet showing
their aspiring tops. Through this lake, the river
Rhodanus passes with that velocity as not to mingle with
its exceeding deep waters, which are very clear, and breed
the most celebrated trout for largeness and goodness of
any in Europe. I have ordinarily seen one of three feet
in length sold in the market for a small price, and such
we had in the lodging where we abode, which was at the
White Cross. All this while, I held up tolerably; and the
next morning having a letter for Signor John Diodati,
the famous Italian minister and translator of the Holy
Bible into that language, I went to his house, and had a
great deal of discourse with that learned person. He told
me he had been in England, driven by tempest into Deal,
while sailing for Holland, that he had seen London, and
was exceedingly taken with the civilities he received. He
so much approved of our Church-government by Bishops,
that he told me the French Protestants would make no
scruple to submit to it and all its pomp, had they a king of
the Reformed religion as we had. He exceedingly deplored
the difference now between his Majesty and the Parliament.
After dinner, came one Monsieur Saladine, with his little
pupil, the Earl of Caernarvon, to visit us, offering to carry
us to the principal places of the town; but, being now no
more able to hold up my head, I was constrained to keep
my chamber, imagining that my very eyes would have
dropped out; and this night I felt such a stinging about
me, that I could not sleep. In the morning, I was very
ill, but sending for a doctor, he persuaded me to be
bled. He was a very learned old man, and, as he said,
he had been physician to Gustavus the Great, King of
Sweden, when he passed this way into Italy, under the
name of Monsieur Gars, the initial letters of Gustavus
Adolphus Rex Sueciæ, and of our famous Duke of Buckingham,
on his returning out of Italy. He afterward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
acknowledged that he should not have bled me, had he
suspected the smallpox, which broke out a day after.
He afterward purged me, and applied leeches, and God
knows what this would have produced, if the spots had
not appeared, for he was thinking of bleeding me again.
They now kept me warm in bed for sixteen days, tended
by a vigilant Swiss matron, whose monstrous throat,
when I sometimes awakened out of unquiet slumbers, would
affright me. After the pimples were come forth, which
were not many, I had much ease as to pain, but infinitely
afflicted with heat and noisomeness. By God's
mercy, after five weeks' keeping my chamber, I went
abroad. Monsieur Saladine and his lady sent me many refreshments.
Monsieur Le Chat, my physician, to excuse
his letting me bleed, told me it was so burnt and vicious
as it would have proved the plague, or spotted fever, had
he proceeded by any other method. On my recovering
sufficiently to go abroad, I dined at Monsieur Saladine's,
and in the afternoon went across the water on the side
of the lake, and took a lodging that stood exceedingly
pleasant, about half a mile from the city for the better
airing; but I stayed only one night, having no company
there, save my pipe; so, the next day, I caused them to
row me about the lake as far as the great stone, which
they call <span class="smcap">Neptune's Rock</span>, on which they say sacrifice
was anciently offered to him. Thence, I landed at certain
cherry gardens and pretty villas by the side of the
lake, and exceedingly pleasant. Returning, I visited
their conservatories of fish; in which were trouts of six
and seven feet long, <span style="font-size:.8em;">AS THEY AFFIRMED</span>.</p>

<p>The Rhone, which parts the city in the midst dips into
a cavern underground, about six miles from it, and afterward
rises again, and runs its open course, like our Mole,
or Swallow, by Dorking, in Surrey. The next morning
(being Thursday) I heard Dr. Diodati preach in Italian,
many of that country, especially of Lucca, his native
place, being inhabitants of Geneva, and of the Reformed
religion.</p>

<p>The town lying between Germany, France, and Italy,
those three tongues are familiarly spoken by the inhabitants.
It is a strong, well-fortified city, part of it built
on a rising ground. The houses are not despicable, but
the high pent-houses (for I can hardly call them clois<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>ters,
being all of wood), through which the people pass
dry and in the shade, winter and summer, exceedingly
deform the fronts of the buildings. Here are abundance
of booksellers; but their books are of ill impressions;
these, with watches (of which store are made here), crystal,
and excellent screwed guns, are the staple commodities.
All provisions are good and cheap.</p>

<p>The town-house is fairly built of stone; the portico has
four black marble columns; and, on a table of the same,
under the city arms, a demi-eagle and cross, between
cross-keys, is a motto, "<span class="smcap">Post Tenebras Lux</span>," and this
inscription:</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Quum anno 1535 profligatâ Romanâ Anti-Christi Tyrannide,
abrogatisq; ejus superstitionibus, sacro-sancta Christi Religio hìc

<p>The territories about the town are not so large as many
ordinary gentlemen have about their country farms, for
which cause they are in continual watch, especially on
the Savoy side; but, in case of any siege the Swiss are
at hand, as this inscription in the same place shows,
toward the street:</p>

<p>In the Senate-house, were fourteen ancient urns, dug
up as they were removing earth in the fortifications.</p>

<p>A little out of the town is a spacious field, which they
call Campus Martius; and well it may be so termed, with
better reason, than that at Rome at present (which is no
more a field, but all built into streets), for here on every
Sunday, after the evening devotions, this precise people
permit their youth to exercise arms, and shoot in guns,
and in the long and cross bows, in which they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
exceedingly expert, reputed to be as dexterous as any people
in the world. To encourage this, they yearly elect
him who has won most prizes at the mark, to be their
king, as the king of the long-bow, gun, or cross-bow.
He then wears that weapon in his hat in gold, with a
crown over it made fast to the hat like a brooch. In
this field, is a long house wherein their arms and furniture
are kept in several places very neatly. To this joins
a hall, where, at certain times, they meet and feast; in
the glass windows are the arms and names of their kings
[of arms]. At the side of the field, is a very noble Pall-Mall,
but it turns with an elbow. There is also a bowling-place,
a tavern, and a trey-table, and here they ride
their menaged horses. It is also the usual place of
public execution of those who suffer for any capital
crime, though committed in another country, by which law
divers fugitives have been put to death, who have fled
hither to escape punishment in their own country.
Among other severe punishments here, adultery is death.
Having seen this field, and played a game at mall, I
supped with Mr. Saladine.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I heard Dr. Diodati preach in French,
and after the French mode, in a gown with a cape, and
his hat on. The Church Government is severely Presbyterian,
after the discipline of Calvin and Beza, who set
it up, but nothing so rigid as either our Scots or English
sectaries of that denomination. In the afternoon, Monsieur
Morice, a most learned young person and excellent poet,
chief Professor of the University, preached at St. Peter's,
a spacious Gothic fabric. This was heretofore a cathedral
and a reverend pile. It has four turrets, on one of
which stands a continual sentinel; in another cannons
are mounted. The church is very decent within; nor
have they at all defaced the painted windows, which are
full of pictures of saints; nor the stalls, which are all
carved with the history of our Blessed Savior.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I went to see the young townsmen
exercise in Mars' Field, where the prizes were pewter-plates
and dishes; 'tis said that some have gained competent
estates by what they have thus won. Here I
first saw huge ballistæ, or cross-bows, shot in, being such
as they formerly used in wars, before great guns were
known; they were placed in frames, and had great screws<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
to bend them, doing execution at an incredible distance.
They were most accurate at the long-bow and musket,
rarely missing the smallest mark. I was as busy with
the carbine I brought from Brescia as any of them.
After every shot, I found them go into a long house, and
cleanse their guns, before they charged again.</p>

<p>On Monday, I was invited to a little garden without
the works, where were many rare tulips, anemones, and
other choice flowers. The Rhone, running athwart the
town out of the Lake, makes half the city a suburb,
which, in imitation of Paris, they call St. Germain's
Fauxbourg, and it has a church of the same name. On
two wooden bridges that cross the river are several
water-mills, and shops of trades, especially smiths and
cutlers; between the bridges is an island, in the midst
of which is a very ancient tower, said to have been
built by Julius Cæsar. At the end of the other bridge
is the mint, and a fair sun-dial.</p>

<p>Passing again by the town-house, I saw a large crocodile
hanging in chains; and against the wall of one of the
chambers, seven judges were painted without hands,
except one in the middle, who has but one hand; I know
not the story. The Arsenal is at the end of this building,
well furnished and kept.</p>

<p>After dinner Mr. Morice led us to the college, a fair
structure; in the lower part are the schools, which consist
of nine classes; and a hall above, where the students
assemble; also a good library. They showed us a very
ancient Bible, of about 300 years old, in the vulgar French,
and a MS. in the old Monkish character: here have the
Professors their lodgings. I also went to the Hospital,
which is very commodious; but the Bishop's Palace is now
a prison.</p>

<p>This town is not much celebrated for beautiful women,
for, even at this distance from the Alps, the gentlewomen
have somewhat full throats; but our Captain Wray (afterward
Sir William, eldest son of that Sir Christopher, who
had both been in arms against his Majesty for the Parliament)
fell so mightily in love with one of Monsieur Saladine's
daughters that, with much persuasion, he could not
be prevailed on to think on his journey into France, the
season now coming on extremely hot.</p>

<p>My sickness and abode here cost me forty-five pistoles of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
gold to my host, and five to my honest doctor, who for six
weeks' attendance and the apothecary thought it so generous
a reward that, at my taking leave, he presented me
with his advice for the regimen of my health, written with
his own hand in Latin. This regimen I much observed,
and I bless God passed the journey without inconvenience
from sickness, but it was an extraordinarily hot unpleasant
season and journey, by reason of the craggy ways.</p>
