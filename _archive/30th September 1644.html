<p>We bargained with a waterman
to carry us to Avignon on the river, and got the first
night to Vienne, in Dauphin√©. This is an Archbishopric,
and the province gives title to the heir-apparent of
France. Here we supped and lay, having among other
dainties, a dish of truffles, which is a certain earth-nut,
found out by a hog trained to it, and for which those
animals are sold at a great price. It is in truth an incomparable
meat. We were shown the ruins of an
amphitheatre, pretty entire; and many handsome palaces,
especially that of Pontius Pilate, not far from the town,
at the foot of a solitary mountain, near the river, having
four pinnacles. Here it is reported he passed his exile,
and precipitated himself into the lake not far from it.
The house is modern, and seems to be the seat of some
gentleman; being in a very pleasant, though melancholy
place. The cathedral of Vienne is St. Maurice; and
there are many other pretty buildings, but nothing more
so, than the mills where they hammer and polish the
sword blades.</p>

<p>Hence, the next morning we swam (for the river here
is so rapid that the boat was only steered) to a small
village called Thein, where we dined. Over against this
is another town, named Tournon, where is a very strong
castle under a high precipice. To the castle joins the
Jesuits' College, who have a fair library. The prospect
was so tempting, that I could not forbear designing it
with my crayon.</p>

<p>We then came to Valence, a capital city carrying the
title of a Duchy; but the Bishop is now sole Lord temporal
of it, and the country about it. The town having
a University famous for the study of the civil law, is
much frequented; but the churches are none of the fairest,
having been greatly defaced in the time of the wars.
The streets are full of pretty fountains. The citadel is
strong and garrisoned. Here we passed the night, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the next morning by Pont St. Esprit, which consists of
twenty-two arches; in the piers of the arches are windows,
as it were, to receive the water when it is high and full.
Here we went on shore, it being very dangerous to pass
the bridge in a boat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AVIGNON</div>

<p>Hence, leaving our barge, we took horse, seeing at a
distance the town and principality of Orange; and, lodging
one night on the way, we arrived at noon at Avignon.
This town has belonged to the Popes ever since the time
of Clement V.; being, in 1352, alienated by Jane, Queen
of Naples and Sicily. Entering the gates, the soldiers
at the guard took our pistols and carbines, and examined
us very strictly; after that, having obtained the Governor's
and the Vice-Legate's leave to tarry three days, we were
civilly conducted to our lodging. The city is on the
Rhone, and divided from the newer part, or town, which
is on the other side of the river, by a very fair stone
bridge (which has been broken); at one end is a very
high rock, on which is a strong castle well furnished
with artillery. The walls of the city are of large, square
freestone, the most neat and best in repair I ever saw.
It is full of well-built palaces; those of the Vice-Legate
and Archbishop being the most magnificent. There are
many sumptuous churches, especially that of St. Magdalene
and St. Martial, wherein the tomb of the Cardinal
d'Amboise is the most observable. Clement VI. lies
buried in that of the Celestines, the altar whereof is exceedingly
rich: but for nothing I more admired it than the
tomb of Madonna Laura, the celebrated mistress of
Petrarch. We saw the Arsenal, the Pope's palace, and
the Synagogue of the Jews, who here are distinguished
by their red hats. Vaucluse, so much renowned for the
solitude of Petrarch, we beheld from the castle; but
could not go to visit it for want of time, being now
taking mules and a guide for Marseilles.</p>

<p>We lay at Loumas; the next morning, came to Aix,
having passed that extremely rapid and dangerous river
of Durance. In this tract, all the heaths, or commons,
are covered with rosemary, lavender, lentiscus, and the
like sweet shrubs, for many miles together; which to me
was very pleasant. Aix is the chief city of Provence,
being a Parliament and Presidential town, with other
royal Courts and Metropolitan jurisdiction. It is well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
built, the houses very high, and the streets ample. The
Cathedral, St. Savior's, is a noble pile adorned with innumerable
figures; especially that of St. Michael; the
Baptisterie, the Palace, the Court, built in a most spacious
piazza, are very fair. The Duke of Guise's house
is worth seeing, being furnished with many antiquities
in and about it. The Jesuits have here a royal College,
and the City is a University.</p>
