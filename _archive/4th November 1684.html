<p>Dr. Turner, now translated from
Rochester to Ely upon the death of Dr. Peter Gunning,
preached before the King at Whitehall on Romans iii. 8,
a very excellent sermon, vindicating the Church of England
against the pernicious doctrines of the Church of
Rome. He challenged the producing but of five clergymen
who forsook our Church and went over to that of
Rome, during all the troubles and rebellion in England,
which lasted near twenty years; and this was to my certain
observation a great truth.</p>
