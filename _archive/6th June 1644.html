<p>I went by water to visit that goodly
and venerable Abbey of Marmoutiers, being one of the
greatest in the kingdom; to it is a very ample church of
stone, with a very high pyramid. Among other relics
the Monks showed us is the Holy Ampoulle, the same
with that which sacres their Kings at Rheims, this being
the one that anointed Henry IV. Ascending many
steps, we went into the Abbot's Palace, where we were
showed a vast tun (as big as that at Heidelberg), which
they report St. Martin (as I remember) filled from one
cluster of grapes growing there.</p>
