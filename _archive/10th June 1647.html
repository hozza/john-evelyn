<p>We concluded about my marriage, in
order to which I went to St. Germains, where his Majesty,
then Prince of Wales, had his court, to desire of
Dr. Earle, then one of his chaplains (since Dean of Westminster,
Clerk of the Closet, and Bishop of Salisbury), that
he would accompany me to Paris, which he did; and, on
Thursday, 27th of June, 1647, he married us in Sir Richard
Browne's chapel, between the hours of eleven and twelve,
some few select friends being present. And this
being Corpus Christi feast, was solemnly observed in this
country; the streets were sumptuously hung with tapestry,
and strewed with flowers.</p>
