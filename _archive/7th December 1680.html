<p>On Tuesday, I was again at the
trial, when judgment was demanded; and, after my Lord
had spoken what he could in denying the fact, the managers
answering the objections, the Peers adjourned to
their House, and within two hours returned again. There
was, in the meantime, this question put to the judges,
"whether there being but one witness to any single crime,
or act, it could amount to convict a man of treason." They
gave an unanimous opinion that in case of treason they all
were overt acts for though no man should be condemned
by one witness for any one act, yet for several acts to
the same intent, it was valid; which was my Lord's case.
This being past, and the Peers in their seats again, the
Lord Chancellor Finch (this day the Lord High-Steward)
removing to the woolsack next his Majesty's state, after
summoning the Lieutenant of the Tower to bring forth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
his prisoner, and proclamation made for silence, demanded
of every Peer (who were in all eighty-six)
whether William, Lord Viscount Stafford, were guilty of
the treason laid to his charge, or not guilty.</p>

<p>Then the Peer spoken to, standing up, and laying his
right hand upon his breast, said guilty, or not guilty,
upon my honor, and then sat down, the Lord Steward
noting their suffrages as they answered upon a paper:
when all had done, the number of not guilty being but
31, the guilty 55; and then, after proclamation for silence
again, the Lord Steward directing his speech to the
prisoner, against whom the ax was turned edgeways
and not before, in aggravation of his crime, he being
ennobled by the King's father, and since received many
favors from his present Majesty: after enlarging on his
offense, deploring first his own unhappiness that he who
had never condemned any man before should now be
necessitated to begin with him, he then pronounced sentence
of death by hanging, drawing, and quartering,
according to form, with great solemnity and dreadful
gravity; and, after a short pause, told the prisoner that
he believed the Lords would intercede for the omission
of some circumstances of his sentence, beheading only
excepted; and then breaking his white staff, the Court
was dissolved. My Lord Stafford during all this latter
part spoke but little, and only gave their Lordships
thanks after the sentence was pronounced; and indeed
behaved himself modestly, and as became him.</p>

<p>It was observed that all his own relations of his name
and family condemned him, except his nephew, the Earl
of Arundel, son to the Duke of Norfolk. And it must
be acknowledged that the whole trial was carried on
with exceeding gravity: so stately and august an appearance
I had never seen before; for, besides the innumerable
spectators of gentlemen and foreign ministers, who saw
and heard all the proceedings, the prisoner had the consciences
of all the Commons of England for his accusers,
and all the Peers to be his judges and jury. He had
likewise the assistance of what counsel he would, to direct
him in his plea, who stood by him. And yet I can hardly
think that a person of his age and experience should engage
men whom he never saw before (and one of them
that came to visit him as a stranger at Paris) <span class="small">POINT<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
BLANK</span> to murder the King: God only, who searches hearts,
can discover the truth. Lord Stafford was not a man
beloved especially of his own family.</p>
