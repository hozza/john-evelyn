<p>I was present, and saw and heard
the humble submission and petition of the Lord Mayor,
sheriffs, and aldermen, on behalf of the city of London,
on the <i>quo warranto</i> against their charter which they
delivered to his Majesty in the presence chamber. It
was delivered kneeling, and then the King and Council
went into the council chamber, the mayor and his brethren
attending still in the presence chamber. After a
short space they were called in, and my Lord Keeper
made a speech to them, exaggerating the disorderly and
riotous behavior in the late election, and polling for
Papillon and Du Bois after the Common hall had been
formally dissolved: with other misdemeanors, libels on
the government, etc., by which they had incurred his
Majesty's high displeasure: and that but for this submission,
and under such articles as the King should require their
obedience to, he would certainly enter judgment against
them, which hitherto he had suspended. The things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
required were as follows: that they should neither elect
mayor, sheriffs, aldermen, recorder, common Serjeant
town clerk, coroner, nor steward of Southwark, without
his Majesty's approbation; and that if they presented any
his Majesty did not like, they should proceed in wonted
manner to a second choice; if that was disapproved, his
Majesty to nominate them; and if within five days they
thought good to assent to this, all former miscarriages
should be forgotten. And so they tamely parted with
their so ancient privileges after they had dined and been
treated by the King. This was a signal and most
remarkable period. What the consequences will prove,
time will show. Divers of the old and most learned
lawyers and judges were of opinion that they could not
forfeit their charter, but might be personally punished
for their misdemeanors; but the plurality of the younger
judges and rising men judged it otherwise.</p>

<p>The Popish Plot also, which had hitherto made such a
noise, began now sensibly to dwindle, through the folly,
knavery, impudence, and giddiness of Oates, so as the
Papists began to hold up their heads higher than ever,
and those who had fled, flocked to London from abroad.
Such sudden changes and eager doings there had been
without anything steady or prudent, for these last seven
years.</p>
