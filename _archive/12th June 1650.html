<p>Being Trinity Sunday, the Dean of
Peterborough preached; after which there was an ordination
of two divines, Durell and Brevent (the one was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
afterward Dean of Windsor, the other of Durham,
both very learned persons). The Bishop of Galloway
officiated with great gravity, after a pious and learned
exhortation declaring the weight and dignity of their
function, especially now in a time of the poor Church of
England's affliction. He magnified the sublimity of the
calling, from the object, viz, the salvation of men's souls,
and the glory of God; producing many human instances
of the transitoriness and vanity of all other dignity; that
of all the triumphs the Roman conquerors made, none
was comparable to that of our Blessed Savior's, when he
led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men, namely, that
of the Holy Spirit, by which his faithful and painful
ministers triumphed over Satan as often as they reduced a
sinner from the error of his ways. He then proceeded
to the ordination. They were presented by the Dean in
their surplices before the altar, the Bishop sitting in a
chair at one side; and so were made both Deacons and
Priests at the same time, in regard to the necessity of
the times, there being so few Bishops left in England,
and consequently danger of a failure of both functions.
Lastly, they proceeded to the Communion. This was all
performed in Sir Richard Browne's chapel, at Paris.</p>
