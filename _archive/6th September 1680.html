<p>I dined with Sir Stephen Fox,
now one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.
This gentleman came first a poor boy from the choir of
Salisbury, then he was taken notice of by Bishop Duppa,
and afterward waited on my Lord Percy (brother to
Algernon, Earl of Northumberland), who procured for him
an inferior place among the clerks of the kitchen and Greencloth
side, where he was found so humble, diligent, industrious,
and prudent in his behavior, that his Majesty
being in exile, and Mr. Fox waiting, both the King and
Lords about him frequently employed him about their
affairs, and trusted him both with receiving and paying
the little money they had. Returning with his Majesty
to England, after great want and great sufferings, his
Majesty found him so honest and industrious, and withal
so capable and ready, that, being advanced from clerk of
the kitchen to that of the Greencloth, he procured to be
paymaster of the whole army, and by his dexterity and
punctual dealing he obtained such credit among the
bankers, that he was in a short time able to borrow vast
sums of them upon any exigence. The continual turning
thus of money, and the soldiers' moderate allowance to
him for keeping touch with them, did so enrich him, that
he is believed to be worth at least £200,000, honestly got
and unenvied; which is next to a miracle. With all this
he continues as humble and ready to do a courtesy as
ever he was.</p>

<p>He is generous, and lives very honorably, of a sweet
nature, well-spoken, well-bred, and is so highly in his
Majesty's esteem, and so useful, that being long since
made a knight, he is also advanced to be one of the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and has the reversion
of the Cofferer's place after Harry Brouncker. He
has married his eldest daughter to my Lord Cornwallis,
and gave her £12,000, and restored that entangled family
besides. He matched his son to Mrs. Trollop, who brings
with her (besides a great sum) near, if not altogether,
£2,000 per annum. Sir Stephen's lady (an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
woman) is sister to Mr. Whittle, one of the King's chirurgeons.
In a word, never was man more fortunate than
Sir Stephen; he is a handsome person, virtuous, and very
religious.</p>
