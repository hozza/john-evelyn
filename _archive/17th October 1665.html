<p>I went to Gravesend; next day to
Chatham; thence to Maidstone, in order to the march of
500 prisoners to Leeds Castle, which I had hired of Lord
Culpeper. I was earnestly desired by the learned Sir
Roger Twisden, and Deputy-Lieutenants, to spare Maidstone
from quartering any of my sick flock. Here, Sir
Edward Brett sent me some horse to bring up the rear.
This country, from Rochester to Maidstone and the Downs,
is very agreeable for the prospect.</p>
