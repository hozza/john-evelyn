<p>I repaired with my brother to the
term, to go into our new lodgings (that were formerly in
Essex-court), being a very handsome apartment just over
against the Hall-court, but four pair of stairs high, which
gave us the advantage of the fairer prospect; but did not
much contribute to the love of that impolished study, to
which (I suppose) my father had designed me, when he
paid Â£145 to purchase our present lives, and assignments
afterward.</p>

<p>London, and especially the Court, were at this period
in frequent disorders, and great insolences were committed
by the abused and too happy City: in particular,
the Bishop of Canterbury's Palace at Lambeth was assaulted
by a rude rabble from Southwark, my Lord
Chamberlain imprisoned and many scandalous libels and
invectives scattered about the streets, to the reproach of
Government, and the fermentation of our since distractions:
so that, upon the 25th of June, I was sent for to
Wotton, and the 27th after, my father's indisposition
augmenting, by advice of the physicians he repaired to
the Bath.</p>
