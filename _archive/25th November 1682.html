<p>I was invited to dine with
Monsieur Lionberg, the Swedish Resident, who made a
magnificent entertainment, it being the birthday of his
King. There dined the Duke of Albemarle, Duke of
Hamilton, Earl of Bath, Earl of Aylesbury, Lord Arran,
Lord Castlehaven, the son of him who was executed fifty
years before, and several great persons. I was exceedingly
afraid of drinking (it being a Dutch feast), but the Duke
of Albemarle being that night to wait on his Majesty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
excess was prohibited; and, to prevent all, I stole away
and left the company as soon as we rose from table.</p>
