<p>I dined at our great Lord Chancellor
Jefferies', who used me with much respect. This
was the late Chief-Justice who had newly been the Western
Circuit to try the Monmouth conspirators, and had
formerly done such severe justice among the obnoxious
in Westminster Hall, for which his Majesty dignified
him by creating him first a Baron, and now Lord Chancellor.
He had some years past been conversant in
Deptford; is of an assured and undaunted spirit, and has
served the Court interest on all the hardiest occasions; is
of nature cruel, and a slave of the Court.</p>
