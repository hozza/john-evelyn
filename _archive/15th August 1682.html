<p>Came to visit me Dr. Rogers, an
acquaintance of mine long since at Padua. He was then
Consul of the English nation, and student in that University,
where he proceeded Doctor in Physic; presenting
me now with the Latin oration he lately made upon the
famous Dr. Harvey's anniversary in the College of Physicians,
at London.</p>
