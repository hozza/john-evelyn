<p>I went to church at Godstone,
and to see old Sir John Evelyn's <span class="small">DORMITORY</span>, joining to
the church, paved with marble, where he and his Lady
lie on a very stately monument at length; he in armor
of white marble. The inscription is only an account
of his particular branch of the family, on black marble.</p>
