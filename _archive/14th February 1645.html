<p>I went to Santa Cecilia, a church
built and endowed by Cardinal Sfrond√¶ti, who has erected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
a stately altar near the body of this martyr, not long before
found in a vesture of silk girt about, a veil on her
head, and the bloody scars of three wounds on the neck;
the body is now in a silver chest, with her statue over it,
in snow-white marble. Other Saints lie here, decorated
with splendid ornaments, lamps, and incensories of great
cost. A little farther, they show us the Bath of St.
Cecilia, to which joins a Convent of Friars, where is the
picture of the Flagellation by Vanni, and the columns of
the portico, taken from the Baths of Septimius Severus.</p>
