<p>We were all three Commissioners
sworn on our knees by the Clerk of the Crown, before
my Lord Chancellor, three several oaths: allegiance,
supremacy, and the oath belonging to the Lord Privy
Seal, which last we took standing. After this, the Lord
Chancellor invited us all to dinner, but it being Christmas
eve we desired to be excused, intending at three in
the afternoon to seal divers things which lay ready at
the office; so attended by three of the Clerks of the Signet,
we met and sealed. Among other things was a pardon
to West, who being privy to the late conspiracy, had
revealed the accomplices to save his own neck. There
were also another pardon and two indenizations; and so
agreeing to a fortnight's vacation, I returned home.</p>
