<p>Now were there papers, speeches, and
libels, publicly cried in the streets against the Dukes of
York and Lauderdale, etc., obnoxious to the Parliament,
with too much and indeed too shameful a liberty; but
the people and Parliament had gotten head by reason of
the vices of the great ones.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LONDON</div>

<p>There was now brought up to London a child, son of
one Mr. Wotton, formerly amanuensis to Dr. Andrews,
Bishop of Winton, who both read and perfectly understood
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Syriac, and most of
the modern languages; disputed in divinity, law, and all
the sciences; was skillful in history, both ecclesiastical and
profane; in politics; in a word, so universally and solidly
learned at eleven years of age, that he was looked on as
a miracle. Dr. Lloyd, one of the most deeply learned
divines of this nation in all sorts of literature, with Dr.
Burnet, who had severely examined him, came away
astonished, and they told me they did not believe there
had the like appeared in the world. He had only been
instructed by his father, who being himself a learned
person, confessed that his son knew all that he himself
knew. But, what was more admirable than his vast
memory, was his judgment and invention, he being tried
with divers hard questions, which required maturity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
thought and experience. He was also dexterous in chronology,
antiquities, mathematics. In sum, an <i>intellectus
universalis</i>, beyond all that we read of Picus Mirandula,
and other precocious wits, and yet withal a very humble
child.</p>
