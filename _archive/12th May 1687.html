<p>To London. Lord Sunderland being
Lord President and Secretary of State, was made Knight
of the Garter and Prime favorite. This day there was

sort of hurricane. It kept the flood out of the Thames,
so that people went on foot over several places above
bridge. Also an earthquake in several places in England
about the time of the storm.</p>
