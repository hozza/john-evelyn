<p>This magnificent train on horseback, as rich as embroidery,

could make them and their prancing horses, proceeded
through the streets strewed with flowers, houses hung
with rich tapestry, windows and balconies full of ladies;
the London militia lining the ways, and the several com<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>panies,
with their banners and loud music, ranked in
their orders; the fountains running wine, bells ringing,
with speeches made at the several triumphal arches; at
that of the Temple Bar (near which I stood) the Lord
Mayor was received by the Bailiff of Westminster, who,
in a scarlet robe, made a speech. Thence, with joyful
acclamations, his Majesty passed to Whitehall. Bonfires
at night.</p>

<p>The next day, being St. George's, he went by water to
Westminster Abbey. When his Majesty was entered, the
Dean and Prebendaries brought all the regalia, and
delivered them to several noblemen to bear before the
King, who met them at the west door of the church,
singing an anthem, to the choir. Then, came the Peers,
in their robes, and coronets in their hands, till his Majesty
was placed on a throne elevated before the altar. Afterward,
the Bishop of London (the Archbishop of Canterbury
being sick) went to every side of the throne to
present the King to the people, asking if they would have
him for their King, and do him homage; at this,
they shouted four times "God save King Charles II!"
Then, an anthem was sung. His Majesty, attended by
three Bishops, went up to the altar, and he offered a pall
and a pound of gold. Afterward, he sat down in another
chair during the sermon, which was preached by Dr.
Morley, Bishop of Worcester.</p>

<p>After sermon, the King took his oath before the altar
to maintain the religion, Magna Charta, and laws of the
land. The hymn <i>VÃ©ni S. Sp.</i> followed, and then the
Litany by two Bishops. Then the Archbishop of Canterbury,
present, but much indisposed and weak, said "Lift
up your hearts"; at which, the King rose up, and put off
his robes and upper garments, and was in a waistcoat so
opened in divers places, that the Archbishop might commodiously
anoint him, first in the palms of his hands,
when an anthem was sung, and a prayer read; then, his
breast and between the shoulders, bending of both arms;
and, lastly, on the crown of the head, with apposite hymns
and prayers at each anointing; this done, the Dean closed
and buttoned up the waistcoat. After which, was a coif
put on, and the cobbium, sindon or dalmatic, and over
this a super-tunic of cloth of gold, with buskins and
sandals of the same, spurs, and the sword; a prayer being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
first said over it by the Archbishop on the altar, before
it was girt on by the Lord Chamberlain. Then, the
armill, mantle, etc. Then, the Archbishop placed the
crown imperial on the altar, prayed over it, and set it on
his Majesty's head, at which all the Peers put on their
coronets. Anthems, and rare music, with lutes, viols,
trumpets, organs, and voices, were then heard, and the
Archbishop put a ring on his Majesty's finger. The King
next offered his sword on the altar, which being redeemed,
was drawn, and borne before him. Then, the Archbishop
delivered him the sceptre, with the dove in one hand, and,
in the other, the sceptre with the globe. The King kneeling,
the Archbishop pronounced the blessing. His Majesty
then ascending again his royal throne, while <i>Te Deum</i>
was singing, all the Peers did their homage, by every one
touching his crown. The Archbishop, and the rest of the
Bishops, first kissing the King; who received the Holy Sacrament,
and so disrobed, yet with the crown imperial on
his head, and accompanied with all the nobility in the
former order, he went on foot upon blue cloth, which was
spread and reached from the west door of the Abbey to
Westminster stairs, when he took water in a triumphal
barge to Whitehall where was extraordinary feasting.</p>
