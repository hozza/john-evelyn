<p>We came to Canterbury: and,
next morning, to Dover.</p>

<p>There was in my Lady Ambassadress's company my
Lady Hamilton, a sprightly young lady, much in the
good graces of the family, wife of that valiant and worthy
gentleman, George Hamilton, not long after slain in
the wars. She had been a maid of honor to the Duchess,
and now turned Papist.</p>

<p>14th <a id="tn_png_121"></a><!--TN: Comma added after "November"-->November, 1675. Being Sunday, my Lord having
before delivered to me his letter of attorney, keys, seal,
and his Will, we took a solemn leave of one another upon
the beach, the coaches carrying them into the sea to
the boats, which delivered them to Captain Gunman's
yacht, the "Mary." Being under sail, the castle gave them
seventeen guns, which Captain Gunman answered with
eleven. Hence, I went to church, to beg a blessing on
their voyage.</p>
