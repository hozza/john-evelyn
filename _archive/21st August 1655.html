<p>I went to Ryegate, to visit Mrs.
Cary, at my Lady Peterborough's, in an ancient monastery
well in repair, but the park much defaced; the house is
nobly furnished. The chimney-piece in the great chamber,
carved in wood, was of Henry VIII., and was taken from
a house of his in Bletchingley. At Ryegate, was now
the Archbishop of Armagh, the learned James Usher,
whom I went to visit. He received me exceeding kindly.
In discourse with him, he told me how great the loss of
time was to study much the Eastern languages; that, excepting
Hebrew, there was little fruit to be gathered of
exceeding labor; that, besides some mathematical books,
the Arabic itself had little considerable; that the best
text was the Hebrew Bible; that the Septuagint was finished
in seventy days, but full of errors, about which he
was then writing; that St. Hierome's was to be valued
next the Hebrew; also that the seventy translated the
Pentateuch only, the rest was finished by others; that the
Italians at present understood but little Greek, and Kircher
was a mountebank; that Mr.Â Selden's best book was his
"Titles of Honor"; that the church would be destroyed
by sectaries, who would in all likelihood bring in Popery.
In conclusion he recommended to me the study of philology,
above all human studies; and so, with his blessing,
I took my leave of this excellent person, and returned to
Wotton.</p>
