<p>Came home by Greenwich ferry, where
I saw Sir J. Winter's project of charring sea-coal, to burn
out the sulphur, and render it sweet. He did it by burning
the coals in such earthen pots as the glass men melt
their metal, so firing them without consuming them, using
a bar of iron in each crucible, or pot, which bar has a
hook at one end, that so the coals being melted in a
furnace with other crude sea-coals under them, may be
drawn out of the pots sticking to the iron, whence they
are beaten off in great half-exhausted cinders, which being
rekindled, make a clear, pleasant chamber-fire, deprived
of their sulphur and arsenic malignity. What success it
may have, time will discover.<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_55_55">55</a></p>
