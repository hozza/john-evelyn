<p>A villainous murder was perpetrated
by Mr. St. John, eldest son to Sir Walter St. John,
a worthy gentleman, on a knight of quality, in a tavern.
The offender was sentenced and reprieved. So many
horrid murders and duels were committed about this time
as were never before heard of in England; which gave
much cause of complaint and murmurings.</p>

<p>1st January, 1684-85. It proved so sharp weather, and
so long and cruel a frost, that the Thames was frozen
across, but the frost was often dissolved, and then froze again.</p>
