<p>I went to visit Mr. Hobbes, the
famous philosopher of Malmesbury, with whom I had
long acquaintance. From his window we saw the whole
equipage and glorious cavalcade of the young French
Monarch, Louis XIV., passing to Parliament, when first
he took the kingly government on him, now being in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
14th year, out of his minority and the Queen Regent's
pupilage. First came the <a id="tn_png_296"></a><!--TN: "captan" changed to "captain"-->captain of the King's Aids, at
the head of 50, richly liveried; next, the Queen-Mother's
Light Horse, 100, the lieutenant being all over covered
with embroidery and ribbons, having before him four
trumpets habited in black velvet, full of lace, and casques
of the same. Then, the King's Light Horse, 200, richly
habited, with four trumpets in blue velvet embroidered
with gold, before whom rode the Count d'Olonne coronet
[cornet], whose belt was set with pearl. Next went the
grand Prévôt's company on foot, with the Prévôt on
horseback; after them, the Swiss in black velvet toques,
led by two gallant cavaliers habited in scarlet-colored
satin, after their country fashion, which is very fantastic;
he had in his cap a <i>pennach</i> of heron, with a band of
diamonds, and about him twelve little Swiss boys, with
halberds. Then, came the <i>Aide des Cérémonies</i>; next,
the grandees of court, governors of places and lieutenants-general
of provinces, magnificently habited and
mounted; among whom I must not forget the Chevalier
Paul, famous for many sea-fights and signal exploits
there, because it is said he had never been an Academist,
and yet governed a very unruly horse, and besides his
rich suit his Malta Cross was esteemed at 10,000 crowns.
These were headed by two trumpets, and the whole
troop, covered with gold, jewels, and rich caparisons,
were followed by six trumpets in blue velvet also, preceding
as many heralds in blue velvet <i>semée</i> with fleurs-de-lis,
caduces in their hands, and velvet caps on their
heads; behind them, came one of the masters of the
ceremonies; then, divers marshals and many of the nobility,
exceeding splendid; behind them Count d'Harcourt,
grand Ecuyer, alone, carrying the King's sword in a
scarf, which he held up in a blue sheath studded with fleurs-de-lis;
his horse had for reins two scarfs of black <a id="tn_png_296a"></a><!--TN: "taffet" changed to "taffeta"-->taffeta.</p>

<p>Then came abundance of footmen and pages of the King,
new-liveried with white and red feathers; next, the <i>garde
du corps</i> and other officers; and lastly, appeared the King
himself on an Isabella barb, on which a housing <i>semee</i>,
with crosses of the Order of the Holy Ghost, and fleurs-de-lis;
the King himself, like a young Apollo, was in a
suit so covered with rich embroidery, that one could
perceive nothing of the stuff under it; he went almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the whole way with his hat in hand, saluting the ladies
and acclamators, who had filled the windows with their
beauty, and the air with <i>Vive le Roi</i>. He seemed a
prince of a grave yet sweet countenance. After the
King, followed divers great persons of the Court, exceeding
splendid, also his esquires; masters of horse, on
foot; then the company of <i>Exempts des Gardes</i>, and six
guards of Scotch. Between their files were divers princes
of the blood, dukes, and lords; after all these, the
Queen's guard of Swiss, pages, and footmen; then, the
Queen-Mother herself, in a rich coach, with Monsieur the
King's brother, the Duke of Orleans, and some other
lords and ladies of honor. About the coach, marched
her <i>Exempts des Gardes</i>: then the company of the King's
<i>Gens d'armes</i>, well mounted, 150, with four trumpets,
and as many of the Queen's; lastly, an innumerable
company of coaches full of ladies and gallants. In this
equipage, passed the monarch to the Parliament, henceforth
exercising his kingly government.</p>
