<p>Saw the superb funeral of the protector.
He was carried from Somerset House in a velvet
bed of state, drawn by six horses, housed with the same;
the pall held by his new lords; Oliver lying in effigy,
in royal robes, and crowned with a crown, sceptre, and
globe, like a king. The pendants and guidons were carried
by the officers of the army; the imperial banners,
achievements, etc., by the heralds in their coats; a rich
caparisoned horse, embroidered all over with gold; a
knight of honor, armed <i>cap-a-pie</i>, and, after all, his
guards, soldiers, and innumerable mourners. In this equipage,
they proceeded to Westminster: but it was the most
joyful funeral I ever saw; for there were none that cried
but dogs, which the soldiers hooted away with a barbarous
noise, drinking and taking tobacco in the streets as
they went.</p>

<p>I returned not home till the 17th of November.</p>

<p>I was summoned again to London by the <a id="tn_png_361"></a><!--TN: "commisioners" changed to "commissioners"-->commissioners
for new foundations to be erected within such a distance
of London.</p>
