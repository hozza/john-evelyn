<p>Having a letter sent me by Mr.
Pepys with this expression at the foot of it, "I have
something to show you that I may not have another
time," and that I would not fail to dine with him. I accordingly
went. After dinner, he had me and Mr. Houblon
(a rich and considerable merchant, whose father had
fled out of Flanders on the persecution of the Duke of
Alva) into a private room, and told us that being lately
alone with his Majesty, and upon some occasion of speaking
concerning my late Lord Arlington dying a Roman
Catholic, who had all along seemed to profess himself a
Protestant, taken all the tests, etc., till the day (I think)
of his death, his Majesty said that as to his inclinations
he had known them long wavering, but from fear of
losing his places, he did not think it convenient to declare
himself. There are, says the King, those who
believe the Church of Rome gives dispensations for going
to church, and many like things, but that is not so; for if
that might have been had, he himself had most reason to
make use of it. <span class="smcap">Indeed</span>, he said, as to <span class="small">SOME MATRIMONIAL
CASES, THERE ARE NOW AND THEN DISPENSATIONS</span>, but hardly
in any cases else.</p>

<p>This familiar discourse encouraged Mr. Pepys to beg
of his Majesty, if he might ask it without offense, and for
that his Majesty could not but observe how it was whispered
among many whether his late Majesty had been
reconciled to the Church of Rome; he again humbly besought
his Majesty to pardon his presumption, if he had
touched upon a thing which did not befit him to look
into. The King ingenuously told him that he both was
and died a Roman Catholic, and that he had not long
since declared that it was upon some politic and state
reasons, best known to himself (meaning the King his
brother), but that he was of that persuasion: he bid him
follow him into his closet, where opening a cabinet, he
showed him two papers, containing about a quarter of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
sheet, on both sides written, in the late King's own
hand, several arguments opposite to the doctrine of the
Church of England, charging her with heresy, novelty,
and the fanaticism of other Protestants, the chief whereof
was, as I remember, our refusing to acknowledge the primacy
and infallibility of the Church of Rome; how impossible
it was that so many ages should never dispute it, till
of late; how unlikely our Savior would leave his Church
without a visible Head and guide to resort to, during his
absence; with the like usual topic; so well penned as to
the discourse as did by no means seem to me to have been
put together by the late King yet written all with his own
hand, blotted and interlined, so as, if indeed it was not given
him by some priest, they might be such arguments and
reasons as had been inculcated from time to time, and
here recollected; and, in the conclusion, showing his
looking on the Protestant religion (and by name the
Church of England) to be without foundation, and consequently
false and unsafe. When his Majesty had shown
him these originals, he was pleased to lend him the
copies of these two papers, attested at the bottom in four
or five lines under his own hand.</p>

<p>These were the papers I saw and read. This nice and
curious passage I thought fit to set down. Though all
the arguments and objections were altogether weak, and
have a thousand times been answered by our divines;
they are such as their priests insinuate among their proselytes,
as if nothing were Catholic but the Church of Rome,
no salvation out of that, no reformation sufferable, bottoming
all their errors on St. Peter's successors' unerring
dictatorship, but proving nothing with any reason,
or taking notice of any objection which could be made
against it. Here all was taken for granted, and upon it
a resolution and preference implied.</p>

<p>I was heartily sorry to see all this, though it was no
other than was to be suspected, by his late Majesty's too
great indifference, neglect, and course of life, that he had
been perverted, and for secular respects only professed
to be of another belief, and thereby giving great advantage
to our adversaries, both the Court and generally the
youth and great persons of the nation becoming dissolute and
highly profane. God was incensed to make his reign very
troublesome and unprosperous, by wars, plagues, fires,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
loss of reputation by an universal neglect of the public
for the love of a voluptuous and sensual life, which a
vicious Court had brought into credit. I think of it with
sorrow and pity, when I consider how good and debonair
a nature that unhappy Prince was; what opportunities he
had to have made himself the most renowned King that
ever swayed the British scepter, had he been firm to
that Church for which his martyred and blessed father
suffered; and had he been grateful to Almighty God, who
so miraculously restored him, with so excellent a religion;
had he endeavored to own and propagate it as he
should have done, not only for the good of his kingdom,
but of all the Reformed Churches in christendom,
now weakened and near ruined through our remissness and
suffering them to be supplanted, persecuted, and destroyed,
as in France, which we took no notice of. The consequence
of this, time will show, and I wish it may proceed
no further. The emissaries and instruments of the
Church of Rome will never rest till they have crushed
the Church of England, as knowing that alone to be able
to cope with them, and that they can never answer her
fairly, but lie abundantly open to the irresistible force
of her arguments, antiquity and purity of her doctrine,
so that albeit it may move God, for the punishment of a
nation so unworthy, to eclipse again the profession of
her here, and darkness and superstition prevail, I am
most confident the doctrine of the Church of England
will never be extinguished, but remain visible, if not
eminent, to the consummation of the world. I have innumerable
reasons that confirm me in this opinion, which
I forbear to mention here.</p>

<p>In the meantime, as to the discourse of his Majesty
with Mr. Pepys, and those papers, as I do exceedingly
prefer his Majesty's free and ingenuous profession of what
his own religion is, beyond concealment upon any politic
accounts, so I think him of a most sincere and honest
nature, one on whose word one may rely, and that he
makes a conscience of what he promises, to perform it.
In this confidence, I hope that the Church of England
may yet subsist, and when it shall please God to open
his eyes and turn his heart (for that is peculiarly in the
Lord's hands) to flourish also. In all events, whatever
does become of the Church of England, it is certainly, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
all the Christian professions on the earth, the most
primitive, apostolical, and excellent.</p>
