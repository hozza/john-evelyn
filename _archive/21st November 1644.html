<p>I was carried to see a great
virtuoso, Cavaliéro Pozzo, who showed us a rare collection
of all kind of antiquities, and a choice library, over
which are the effigies of most of our late men of polite
literature. He had a great collection of the antique
basso-relievos about Rome, which this curious man had
caused to be designed in several folios: many fine medals;
the stone which Pliny calls Enhydros; it had plainly in
it the quantity of half a spoonful of water, of a yellow
pebble color, of the bigness of a walnut. A stone paler
than an amethyst, which yet he affirmed to be the true
carbuncle, and harder than a diamond; it was set in a
ring, without foil, or anything at the bottom, so as it
was transparent, of a greenish yellow, more lustrous
than a diamond. He had very pretty things painted on
crimson velvet, designed in black, and shaded and heightened
with white, set in frames; also a number of choice
designs and drawings.</p>

<p>Hence we walked to the Suburra and Ærarium Saturni,
where yet remain some ruins and an inscription. From
thence to St. Pietro <i>in vinculis</i>, one of the seven churches
on the Esquiline, an old and much-frequented place of
great devotion for the relics there, especially the bodies
of the seven Maccabean brethren, which lie under the
altar. On the wall is a St. Sebastian, of mosaic, after
the Greek manner: but what I chiefly regarded was, that
noble sepulchre of Pope Julius II., the work of M. Angelo;
with that never-sufficiently-to-be-admired statue of Moses,
in white marble, and those of Vita Contemplativa and
Activa, by the same incomparable hand. To this church
belongs a monastery, in the court of whose cloisters grow
two tall and very stately palm trees. Behind these, we
walked a turn among the Baths of Titus, admiring the
strange and prodigious receptacles for water, which the
vulgar call the Setti Sali, now all in heaps.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
