<p>I dined at the Vice-Chancellor's, and
spent the afternoon in seeing the rarities of the public libraries,
and visiting the noble marbles and inscriptions, now
inserted in the walls that compass the area of the
Theater, which were 150 of the most ancient and worthy
treasures of that kind in the learned world. Now, observing
that people approach them too near, some idle
persons began to scratch and injure them, I advised that
a hedge of holly should be planted at the foot of the
wall, to be kept breast-high only to protect them;
which the Vice-Chancellor promised to do the next season.</p>
