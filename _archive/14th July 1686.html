<p>Was sealed at our office the constitution
of certain commissioners to take upon them full
power of all Ecclesiastical affairs, in as unlimited a manner,
or rather greater, than the late High Commission-Court,
abrogated by Parliament; for it had not only
faculty to inspect and visit all Bishops' dioceses, but to
change what laws and statutes they should think fit to
alter among the colleges, though founded by private
men; to punish, suspend, fine, etc., give oaths and call
witnesses. The main drift was to suppress zealous preachers.
In sum, it was the whole power of a Vicar-Generalâ€”note
the consequence! Of the clergy the commissioners
were the Archbishop of Canterbury [Sancroft], Bishop
of Durham [Crewe], and Rochester [Sprat]; of the Temporals,
the Lord Treasurer, the Lord Chancellor [Jefferies]<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
(who alone was ever to be of the quorum), the Chief
justice [Herbert], and Lord President [Earl of Sunderland].</p>
