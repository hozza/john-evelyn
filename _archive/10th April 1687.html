<p>In the last week there was issued a
Dispensation from all obligations and tests, by which
Dissenters and Papists especially had public liberty of
exercising their several ways of worship, without incurring
the penalty of the many Laws and Acts of Parliament to
the contrary. This was purely obtained by the Papists,
thinking thereby to ruin the Church of England, being
now the only church which so admirably and strenuously
opposed their superstition. There was a wonderful concourse
of people at the Dissenters' meeting house in this
parish, and the parish church [Deptford] left exceedingly
thin. What this will end in, God Almighty only knows;
but it looks like confusion, which I pray God avert.</p>
