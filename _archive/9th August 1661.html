<p>I tried several experiments on the
sensitive plant and <i>humilis</i>, which contracted with the
least touch of the sun through a burning glass, though
it rises and opens only when it shines on it.</p>

<p>I first saw the famous Queen Pine brought from Barbadoes,
and presented to his Majesty; but the first that
were ever seen in England were those sent to Cromwell
four years since.</p>

<p>I dined at Mr. Palmer's in Gray's Inn, whose curiosity
excelled in clocks and pendules, especially one that had
innumerable motions, and played nine or ten tunes on the
bells very finely, some of them set in parts: which was
very harmonious. It was wound up but once in a quarter.
He had also good telescopes and mathematical instruments,
choice pictures, and other curiosities. Thence,
we went to that famous mountebank, Jo. Punteus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Kenelm Digby presented every one of us his "Discourse
of the Vegetation of Plants"; and Mr. Henshaw, his
"History of Saltpeter and Gunpowder." I assisted him
to procure his place of French Secretary to the King,
which he purchased of Sir Henry De Vic.</p>

<p>I went to that famous physician, Sir Fr. Prujean, who
showed me his laboratory, his workhouse for turning,
and other mechanics; also many excellent pictures, especially
the Magdalen of Caracci; and some incomparable
<i>paysages</i> done in distemper; he played to me likewise on
the <i>polythore</i>, an instrument having something of the harp,
lute, and theorbo; by none known in England, nor described
by any author, nor used, but by this skillful and
learned Doctor.</p>
