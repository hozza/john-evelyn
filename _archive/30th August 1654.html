<p>Taking leave of my friends, who
had now feasted me more than a month, I, with my
wife, etc., set our faces toward home, and got this evening
to Peterborough, passing by a stately palace
(Thorpe) of St. John's (one deep in the blood of our good
king), built out of the ruins of the Bishop's palace and
cloister. The church is exceeding fair, full of monuments
of great antiquity. Here lies Queen Catherine,
the unhappy wife of Henry VIII., and the no less unfortunate
Mary, Queen of Scots. On the steeple, we
viewed the fens of Lincolnshire, now much inclosed and
drained with infinite expense, and by many sluices, cuts,
mounds, and ingenious mills, and the like inventions;
at which the city and country about it consisting
of a poor and very lazy sort of people, were much
displeased.</p>

<p>Peterborough is a handsome town, and hath another
well-built church.</p>
