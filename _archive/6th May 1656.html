<p>I brought Monsieur le Franc, a young
French Sorbonnist, a proselyte, to converse with Dr.
Taylor; they fell to dispute on original sin, in Latin,
upon a book newly published by the Doctor, who was
much satisfied with the young man. Thence, to see Mr.
Dugdale, our learned antiquary and herald. Returning,
I was shown the three vast volumes of Father Kircher's,
"<i>Obeliscus Pamphilius</i>" and "<i>Ægyptiacus</i>"; in the second
volume I found the hieroglyphic I first communicated and
sent to him at Rome by the hands of Mr. Henshaw,
whom he mentions; I designed it from the stone itself
brought me to Venice from Cairo by Captain Powell.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>
