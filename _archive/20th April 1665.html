<p>To Whitehall, to the King, who called
me into his bedchamber as he was dressing, to whom, I
showed the letter written to me from the Duke of York
from the fleet, giving me notice of young Evertzen, and
some considerable commanders newly taken in fight with
the Dartmouth and Diamond frigates, whom he had sent
me as prisoners at war; I went to know of his Majesty
how he would have me treat them, when he commanded
me to bring the young captain to him, and to take the
word of the Dutch Ambassador (who yet remained here)
for the other, that he should render himself to me whenever
I called on him, and not stir without leave. Upon
which I desired more guards, the prison being Chelsea
House. I went also to Lord Arlington (the Secretary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Bennet lately made a Lord) about other business. Dined
at my Lord Chancellor's; none with him but Sir Sackville
Crowe, formerly Ambassador at Constantinople; we were
very cheerful and merry.</p>

<p>24th April, <a id="tn_png_14"></a><!--TN: Period added after "1665"-->1665. I presented young Captain Evertzen
(eldest son of Cornelius, Vice-Admiral of Zealand and
nephew of John, now Admiral, a most valiant person) to
his Majesty in his bed-chamber. The King gave him his
hand to kiss, and restored him his liberty; asked many
questions concerning the fight (it being the first blood
drawn), his Majesty remembering the many civilities he
had formerly received from his relations abroad, who had
now so much interest in that considerable Province. Then,
I was commanded to go with him to the Holland Ambassador,
where he was to stay for his passport, and I was
to give him fifty pieces in broad gold. Next day I had
the Ambassador's parole for the other Captain, taken in
Captain Allen's fight before Calais. I gave the King an
account of what I had done, and afterward asked the same
favor for another Captain, which his Majesty gave me.</p>
