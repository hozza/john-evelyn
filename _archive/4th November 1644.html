<p>After a little riding, we descended
toward the Lake of Bolsena, which being above twenty
miles in circuit, yields from hence a most incomparable
prospect. Near the middle of it are two small islands,
in one of which is a convent of melancholy Capuchins,
where those of the Farnesian family are interred. Pliny
calls it <i>Tarquiniensis Lacus</i>, and talks of divers floating
islands about it, but they did not appear to us. The
lake is environed with mountains, at one of whose sides
we passed toward the town Bolsena, anciently Volsinium,
famous in those times, as is testified by divers rare sculptures
in the court of St. Christiana's church, the urn,
altar, and jasper columns.</p>

<p>After seven miles' riding, passing through a wood
heretofore sacred to Juno, we came to Montefiascone,
the head of the Falisci, a famous people in old time,
and heretofore Falernum, as renowned for its excellent
wine, as now for the story of the Dutch Bishop, who
lies buried in St. Flavian's church with this epitaph:</p>

<p class="center" style="font-size:.9em;">"<i>Propter Est, Est, dominus meus mortuus est.</i>"</p>

<p class="continue">Because, having ordered his servant to ride before, and
inquire where the best wine was, and there write <i>Est</i>,
the man found some so good that he wrote <i>Est, Est</i>,
upon the vessels, and the Bishop drinking too much of
it, died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VITERBO</div>

<p>From Montefiascone, we travel a plain and pleasant
champaign to Viterbo, which presents itself with much
state afar off, in regard of her many lofty pinnacles and
towers; neither does it deceive our expectation; for it is
exceedingly beautified with public fountains, especially
that at the entrance, which is all of brass and adorned
with many rare figures, and salutes the passenger with a
most agreeable object and refreshing waters. There are
many Popes buried in this city, and in the palace is
this odd inscription:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Osiridis victoriam in Gigantas litteris historiographicis in hoc
antiquissimo marmore inscriptam, ex Herculis olim, nunc Divi
Laurentij Templo translatam, ad conversanda: <a id="tn_png_125"></a><!--TN: Period changed to a colon after after "vetustiss"-->vetustiss: patriæ
monumenta atq' decora his locandum statuit S.P.Q.V.</i>"</p>

<p>Under it:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Sum Osiris Rex Jupiter universo in terrarum orbe.</i>"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Sum Osiris Rex qui ab Itala in Gigantes exercitus veni, vidi,
et vici.</i>"</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Sum Osiris Rex <a id="tn_png_126"></a><!--TN: "qu" changed to "qui"-->qui terrarum pacata Italiam decem a'nos quorum
inventor fui.</i>"</p>

<p>Near the town is a sulphurous fountain, which continually
boils. After dinner we took horse by the new
way of Capranica, and so passing near Mount Ciminus
and the Lake, we began to enter the plains of Rome;
at which sight my thoughts were strangely elevated, but
soon allayed by so violent a shower, which fell just as
we were contemplating that proud Mistress of the world,
and descending by the Vatican (for at that gate we
entered), that before we got into the city I was wet to
the skin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROME</div>

<p>I came to Rome on the 4th of November, 1644,
about five at night; and being perplexed for a convenient
lodging, wandered up and down on horseback, till at last
one conducted us to Monsieur Petit's, a Frenchman, near
the Piazza Spagnola. Here I alighted, and, having bargained
with my host for twenty crowns a month, I caused
a good fire to be made in my chamber and went to bed,
being so very wet. The next morning (for I was resolved
to spend no time idly here) I got acquainted with several
persons who had long lived at Rome. I was especially
recommended to Father John, a Benedictine monk and
Superior of his Order for the English College of Douay,
a person of singular learning, religion, and humanity;
also to Mr. Patrick Cary, an Abbot, brother to our
learned Lord Falkland, a witty young priest, who afterward
came over to our church; Dr. Bacon and Dr. Gibbs,
physicians who had dependence on Cardinal Caponi, the
latter being an excellent poet; Father Courtney, the
chief of the Jesuits in the English College; my Lord
of Somerset, brother to the Marquis of Worcester; and
some others, from whom I received instructions how to
behave in town, with directions to masters and books to
take in search of the antiquities, churches, collections,
etc. Accordingly, the next day, November 6th, I began
to be very pragmatical.<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23_23">23</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>In the first place, our sights-man (for so they name
certain persons here who get their living by leading
strangers about to see the city) went to the Palace Farnese,
a magnificent square structure, built by Michael
Angelo, of the three orders of columns after the ancient
manner, and when architecture was but newly recovered
from the Gothic barbarity. The court is square and terraced,
having two pairs of stairs which lead to the upper
rooms, and conducted us to that famous gallery painted
by Augustine Caracci, than which nothing is more rare of
that art; so deep and well-studied are all the figures, that
it would require more judgment than I confess I had, to
determine whether they were flat, or embossed. Thence,
we passed into another, painted in chiaroscúro, representing
the fabulous history of Hercules. We went out on a
terrace, where was a pretty garden on the leads, for it is
built in a place that has no extent of ground backward.
The great hall is wrought by Salviati and Zuccharo, furnished
with statues, one of which being modern is the
figure of a Farnese, in a triumphant posture, of white
marble, worthy of admiration. Here we were shown the
Museum of Fulvius Ursinos, replete with innumerable
collections; but the Major-Domo being absent, we could
not at this time see all we wished. Descending into the
court, we with astonishment contemplated those two incomparable
statues of Hercules and Flora, so much celebrated
by Pliny, and indeed by all antiquity, as two of the
most rare pieces in the world; there likewise stands a
modern statue of Hercules and two Gladiators, not to be
despised. In a second court was a temporary shelter of
boards over the most stupendous and <a id="tn_png_127"></a><!--TN: "suffiently" changed to "sufficiently"-->never-to-be-sufficiently-admired
Torso of Amphion and Dirce, represented
in five figures, exceeding the life in magnitude, of the
purest white marble, the contending work of those famous
statuaries, Apollonius and Taurisco, in the time of Augustus,
hewed out of one entire stone, and remaining unblemished,
to be valued beyond all the marbles of the
world for its antiquity and workmanship. There are
divers other heads and busts. At the entrance of this
stately palace stand two rare and vast fountains of garnito
stone, brought into this piazza out of Titus's Baths.
Here, in summer, the gentlemen of Rome take the <span style="font-size:.8em;">FRESCO</span>
in their coaches and on foot. At the sides of this court,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
we visited the palace of Signor Pichini, who has a good
collection of antiquities, especially the Adonis of Parian
marble, which my Lord Arundel would once have purchased,
if a great price would have been taken for it.</p>

<p>We went into the <span class="smcap">Campo Vaccino</span>, by the ruins of the
Temple of Peace, built by Titus Vespasianus, and thought
to be the largest as well as the most richly furnished of
all the Roman dedicated places: it is now a heap rather
than a temple, yet the roof and <i>volto</i> continue firm, showing
it to have been formerly of incomparable workmanship.
This goodly structure was, none knows how,
consumed by fire the very night, by all computation, that
our blessed Savior was born.</p>

<p>From hence we passed by the place into which Curtius
precipitated himself for the love of his country, now
without any sign of a lake, or vorago. Near this stand
some columns of white marble, of exquisite work, supposed
to be part of the Temple of Jupiter Tonans, built
by Augustus; the work of the capitals (being Corinthian)
and architrave is excellent, full of sacrificing utensils.
There are three other of Jupiter Stator. Opposite to
these are the oratories, or churches, of St. Cosmo and
Damiano, heretofore the Temples of Romulus; a pretty
old fabric, with a tribunal, or tholus within, wrought all
of Mosaic. The gates before it are brass, and the whole
much obliged to Pope Urban VIII. In this sacred place
lie the bodies of those two martyrs; and in a chapel on
the right hand is a rare painting of Cavaliere Baglioni.</p>

<p>We next entered St. Lorenzo in Miranda. The portico
is supported by a range of most stately columns; the inscription
cut in the architrave shows it to have been the
Temple of Faustina. It is now made a fair church, and
has an hospital which joins it. On the same side is St.
Adriano, heretofore dedicated to Saturn. Before this
was once placed a military column, supposed to be set
in the center of the city, from whence they used to compute
the distance of all the cities and places of note
under the dominion of those universal monarchs. To
this church are likewise brazen gates and a noble front;
just opposite we saw the heaps and ruins of Cicero's palace.
Hence we went toward Mons Capitolinus, at the
foot of which stands the arch of Septimus Severus, full
and entire, save where the pedestal and some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
lower members are choked up with ruins and earth.
This arch is exceedingly enriched with sculpture and trophies,
with a large inscription. In the terrestrial and
naval battles here graven, is seen the Roman Aries (the
battering-ram); and this was the first triumphal arch set
up in Rome. The Capitol, to which we climbed by very
broad steps, is built about a square court, at the right
hand of which, going up from Campo Vaccino, gushes a
plentiful stream from the statue of Tiber, in porphyry,
very antique, and another representing Rome; but, above
all, is the admirable figure of Marforius, casting water
into a most ample concha. The front of this court is
crowned with an excellent fabric containing the Courts
of Justice, and where the Criminal Notary sits, and
others. In one of the halls they show the statues of
Gregory XIII. and Paul III., with several others. To
this joins a handsome tower, the whole faciata adorned
with noble statues, both on the outside and on the
battlements, ascended by a double pair of stairs, and a
stately Posario.</p>

<p>In the center of the court stands that incomparable
horse bearing the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, as big as
the life, of Corinthian metal, placed on a pedestal of
marble, esteemed one of the noblest pieces of work now
extant, antique and very rare. There is also a vast head
of a colossean magnitude, of white marble, fixed in the
wall. At the descending stairs are set two horses of
white marble governed by two naked slaves, taken to be
Castor and Pollux, brought from Pompey's Theatre. On
the balustrade, the trophies of Marius against the Cimbrians,
very ancient and instructive. At the foot of the
steps toward the left hand is that Colonna Miliaria, with
the globe of brass on it, mentioned to have been formerly
set in Campo Vaccino. On the same hand, is the palace
of the Signiori Conservatori, or three Consuls, now the
civil governors of the city, containing the fraternities, or
halls and guilds (as we call them), of sundry companies,
and other offices of state. Under the portico within, are
the statues of Augustus Cæsar, a Bacchus, and the so
renowned Colonna Rostrata of Duillius, with the excellent
bassi-relievi. In a smaller court, the statue of Constantine,
on a fountain, a Minerva's head of brass, and that
of Commodus, to which belongs a hand, the thumb whereof<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
is at least an ell long, and yet proportionable; but the
rest of the <i>colosse</i> is lost. In the corner of this court
stand a horse and lion fighting, as big as life, in white
marble, exceedingly valued; likewise the Rape of the
Sabines; two cumbent figures of Alexander and Mammea;
two monstrous feet of a <i>colosse</i> of Apollo; the Sepulchre
of Agrippina; and the standard, or antique measure of
the Roman foot. Ascending by the steps of the other corner,
are inserted four basso-relievos, viz, the triumph and
sacrifice of Marcus Aurelius, which last, for the antiquity
and rareness of the work, I caused my painter, Carlo
Neapolitano, to copy. There are also two statues of the
Muses, and one of Adrian, the Emperor; above stands
the figure of Marius, and by the wall Marsyas bound to
a tree; all of them excellent and antique. Above in the
lobby are inserted into the walls those ancient laws, on
brass, called the Twelve Tables; a fair Madonna of Pietro
Perugino, painted on the wall; near which are the archives,
full of ancient records.</p>

<p>In the great hall are divers excellent paintings of Cavaliero
Giuseppe d'Arpino, a statue in brass of Sextus V.
and of Leo X., of marble. In another hall are many
modern statues of their late Consuls and Governors, set
about with fine antique heads; others are painted by excellent
masters, representing the actions of M. Scævola,
Horatius Cocles, etc. The room where the Conservatori
now feast upon solemn days, is tapestried with crimson
damask, embroidered with gold, having a state or
<i>balduquino</i> of crimson velvet, very rich; the frieze above
rarely painted. Here are in brass, Romulus and Remus
sucking the wolf, of brass, with the Shepherd, Faustulus,
by them; also the boy plucking the thorn out of his foot,
of brass, so much admired by artists. There are also
holy statues and heads of Saints. In a gallery near adjoining
are the names of the ancient Consuls, Prætors,
and Fasti Romani, so celebrated by the learned; also the
figure of an old woman; two others representing Poverty;
and more in fragments. In another large room, furnished
with velvet, are the statue of Adonis, very rare, and
divers antique heads. In the next chamber, is an old
statue of Cicero, one of another Consul, a Hercules in
brass, two women's heads of incomparable work, six
other statues; and, over the chimney, a very rare basso-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>relievo,
and other figures. In a little lobby before the
chapel, is the statue of Hannibal, a Bacchus very antique,
<i>bustoes</i> of Pan and Mercury, with other old heads. All
these noble statues, etc., belong to the city, and cannot
be disposed of to any private person, or removed hence,
but are preserved for the honor of the place, though great
sums have been offered for them by divers Princes,
lovers of art, and antiquity. We now left the Capitol,
certainly one of the most renowned places in the world,
even as now built by the design of the famous M.
Angelo.</p>

<p>Returning home by Ara Cœli, we mounted to it by
more than 100 marble steps, not in devotion, as I observed
some to do on their bare knees, but to see those
two famous statues of Constantine, in white marble,
placed there out of his baths. In this church is a
Madonna, reported to be painted by St. Luke, and a
column, on which we saw the print of a foot, which they
affirm to have been that of the Angel, seen on the Castle
of St. Angelo. Here the feast of our Blessed Savior's
nativity being yearly celebrated with divers pageants,
they began to make the preparation. Having viewed the
Palace and fountain, at the other side of the stairs, we
returned weary to our lodgings.</p>

<p>On the 7th of November, we went again near the
Capitol, toward the Tarpeian rock, where it has a goodly
prospect of the Tiber. Thence, descending by the Tullianum,
where they told us St. Peter was imprisoned,
they showed us a chapel (S. Pietro de Vincoli) in which
a rocky side of it bears the impression of his face. In
the nave of the church gushes a fountain, which they
say was caused by the Apostle's prayers, when having
converted some of his fellow-captives he wanted water
to make them Christians. The painting of the Ascension
is by Raphael. We then walked about Mount Palatinus
and the Aventine, and thence to the Circus Maximus,
capable of holding 40,000 spectators, now a heap of ruins,
converted into gardens. Then by the <i>Forum Boarium</i>,
where they have a tradition that Hercules slew Cacus,
some ruins of his temple remaining. The Temple of
Janus Quadrifrons, having four arches, importing the four
Seasons, and on each side niches for the months, is still
a substantial and pretty entire antiquity. Near to this is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the Arcus Argentariorum. Bending now toward the
Tiber, we went into the Theater of Marcellus, which
would hold 80,000 persons, built by Augustus, and dedicated
to his nephew; the architecture, from what
remains, appears to be inferior to none. It is now wholly
converted into the house of the Savelli, one of the old
Roman families. The people were now generally busy
in erecting temporary triumphs and arches with statues
and flattering inscriptions against his Holiness's grand
procession to St. John di Laterani, among which the
Jews also began one in testimony of gratitude for their
protection under the Papal State. The Palazzo Barberini,
designed by the present Pope's architect, Cavaliero Bernini,
seems from the size to be as princely an object, as
any modern building in Europe. It has a double portico,
at the end of which we ascended by two pair of oval
stairs, all of stone, and void in the well. One of these
led us into a stately hall, the <i>volto</i> whereof was newly
painted <i>á fresco</i>, by the rare hand of Pietro Berretini il
Cortone. To this is annexed a gallery completely furnished
with whatever art can call rare and singular, and
a library full of worthy collections, medals, marbles, and
manuscripts; but, above all, an Egyptian Osiris, remarkable
for its unknown material and antiquity. In one of
the rooms near this hangs the Sposaliccio of St. Sebastian,
the original of Annibal Caracci, of which I procured
a copy, little inferior to the prototype; a table, in
my judgment, superior to anything I had seen in Rome.
In the court is a vast broken guglia, or obelisk, having
divers hieroglyphics cut on it.</p>
