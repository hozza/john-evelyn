<p>A sermon was preached to the
Jews, at Ponte Sisto, who are constrained to sit till the
hour is done; but it is with so much malice in their
countenances, spitting, humming, coughing, and motion,
that it is almost impossible they should hear a word
from the preacher. A conversion is very rare.</p>
