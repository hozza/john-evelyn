<p>There dined with me a French
count, with Sir George Tuke, who came to take leave
of me, being sent over to the Queen-Mother, to break
the marriage of the Duke with the daughter of Chancellor
Hyde. The Queen would fain have undone it; but it
seems matters were reconciled, on great offers of the
Chancellor's to befriend the Queen, who was much in
debt, and was now to have the settlement of her affairs
go through his hands.</p>
