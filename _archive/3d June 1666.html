<p>Whitsunday. After sermon came news
that the Duke of Albemarle was still in fight, and had
been all Saturday, and that Captain Harman's ship (the
Henry) was like to be burnt. Then a letter from Mr.
Bertie that Prince Rupert was come up with his squadron
(according to my former advice of his being loose and in
the way), and put new courage into our fleet, now in a
manner yielding ground; so that now we were chasing
the chasers; that the Duke of Albemarle was slightly
wounded, and the rest still in great danger. So, having
been much wearied with my journey, I slipped home, the
guns still roaring very fiercely.</p>
