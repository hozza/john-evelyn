<p>I was admitted a Fellow-commoner of
Baliol College, Oxford; and, on the 29th, I was matriculated
in the vestry of St. Mary's, where I subscribed the
Articles, and took the oaths: Dr. Baily, head of St. John's,
being vice-chancellor, afterward bishop. It appears by
a letter of my father's, that he was upon treaty with one
Mr. Bathurst (afterward Doctor and President), of Trinity
College, who should have been my tutor; but, lest
my brother's tutor, Dr. Hobbs, more zealous in his life
than industrious to his pupils, should receive it as an
affront, and especially for that Fellow-commoners in
Baliol were no more exempt from exercise than the
meanest scholars there, my father sent me thither to one
Mr. George Bradshaw (<i>nomen invisum!</i> yet the son of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
excellent father, beneficed in Surrey). I ever thought
my tutor had parts enough; but as his ambition made
him much suspected of the College, so his grudge to Dr.
Lawrence, the governor of it (whom he afterward supplanted),
took up so much of his time, that he seldom or
never had the opportunity to discharge his duty to his
scholars. This I perceiving, associated myself with one
Mr. James Thicknesse (then a young man of the foundation,
afterward a Fellow of the house), by whose learned
and friendly conversation I received great advantage.
At my first arrival, Dr. Parkhurst was master: and after
his decease, Dr. Lawrence, a chaplain of his Majesty's
and Margaret Professor, succeeded, an acute and learned
person; nor do I much reproach his severity, considering
that the extraordinary remissness of discipline had
(till his coming) much detracted from the reputation of
that College.</p>

<p>There came in my time to the College one Nathaniel
Conopios, out of Greece, from Cyrill, the patriarch of Constantinople,
who, returning many years after, was made (as
I understand) Bishop of Smyrna. He was the first I ever
saw drink coffee; which custom came not into England
till thirty years after.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7_7">7</a></p>

<p>After I was somewhat settled there in my formalities
(for then was the University exceedingly regular, under
the exact discipline of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury,
then Chancellor), I added, as benefactor to the
library of the College, these books—"<i>ex dono Johannis
Evelyni, hujus Coll. Socio-Commensalis, filii Richardi Evelyni,
è com. Surriæ, armig<sup>r</sup></i>."—</p>

<p>"<i>Zanchii Opera</i>," vols. 1, 2, 3.</p>

<p>"<i>Granado in Thomam Aquinatem</i>," vols. 1, 2, 3.</p>

<p>"<i>Novarini Electa Sacra</i>" and "<i>Cresolii Anthologia Sacra</i>";
authors, it seems, much desired by the students of divinity
there.</p>

<p>Upon the 2d of July, being the first Sunday of the
month, I first received the blessed Sacrament of the Lord's
Supper in the college chapel, one Mr. Cooper, a Fellow
of the house, preaching; and at this time was the Church
of England in her greatest splendor, all things decent,
and becoming the Peace, and the persons that governed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
The most of the following week I spent in visiting the
Colleges, and several rarities of the University, which do
very much affect young comers.</p>
