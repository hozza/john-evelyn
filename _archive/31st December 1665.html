<p>Now blessed be God for his
extraordinary mercies and preservation of me this year,
when thousands, and ten thousands, perished, and were
swept away on each side of me, there dying in our parish
this year 406 of the pestilence!</p>

<p>3d January, 1665-66. I supped in Nonesuch House,<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3_3">3</a>
whither the office of the Exchequer was transferred
during the plague, at my good friend Mr. Packer's, and
took an exact view of the plaster statues and bass-relievos
inserted between the timbers and puncheons of the outside
walls of the Court; which must needs have been the
work of some celebrated Italian. I much admired how
they had lasted so well and entire since the time of Henry
VIII., exposed as they are to the air; and pity it is they
are not taken out and preserved in some dry place; a
gallery would become them. There are some mezzo-relievos
as big as the life; the story is of the Heathen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Gods, emblems, compartments, etc. The palace consists
of two courts, of which the first is of stone, castle like,
by the Lord Lumleys (of whom it was purchased), the
other of timber, a Gothic fabric, but these walls incomparably
beautiful. I observed that the appearing timber-puncheons,
entrelices, etc., were all so covered with scales
of slate, that it seemed carved in the wood and painted,
the slate fastened on the timber in pretty figures, that
has, like a coat of armor, preserved it from rotting.
There stand in the garden two handsome stone pyramids,
and the avenue planted with rows of fair elms, but the
rest of these goodly trees, both of this and of Worcester
Park adjoining, were felled by those destructive and avaricious
rebels in the late war, which defaced one of the
stateliest seats his Majesty had.</p>
