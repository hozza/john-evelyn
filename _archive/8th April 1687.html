<p>I had a rehearing of my great cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
at the Chancery in Westminster Hall, having seven of the
most learned Counsel, my adversary five, among which
were the Attorney General and late Solicitor Finch, son to
the Lord Chancellor Nottingham. The account was at
last brought to one article of the surcharge, and referred
to a Master. The cause lasted two hours and more.</p>
