<p>I dined at the Admiralty, where
was brought in a child not twelve years old, the son of
one Dr. Clench, of the most prodigious maturity of knowledge,
for I cannot call it altogether memory, but something
more extraordinary. Mr. Pepys and myself
examined him, not in any method, but with promiscuous
questions, which required judgment and discernment to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
answer so readily and pertinently. There was not anything
in chronology, history, geography, the several systems
of astronomy, courses of the stars, longitude, latitude,
doctrine of the spheres, courses and sources of rivers,
creeks, harbors, eminent cities, boundaries and bearings
of countries, not only in Europe, but in any other part
of the earth, which he did not readily resolve and demonstrate
his knowledge of, readily drawing out with a
pen anything he would describe. He was able not only
to repeat the most famous things which are left us in
any of the Greek or Roman histories, monarchies, republics,
wars, colonies, exploits by sea and land, but all
the sacred stories of the Old and New Testament; the
succession of all the monarchies, Babylonian, Persian,
Greek, Roman, with all the lower Emperors, Popes,
Heresiarchs, and Councils, what they were called about,
what they determined, or in the controversy about Easter,
the tenets of the Gnostics, Sabellians, Arians, Nestorians;
the difference between St. Cyprian and Stephen about re-baptism,
the schisms. We leaped from that to other
things totally different, to Olympic years, and synchronisms;
we asked him questions which could not be resolved
without considerable meditation and judgment, nay of
some particulars of the Civil Laws, of the Digest and
Code. He gave a stupendous account of both natural
and moral philosophy, and even in metaphysics.</p>

<p>Having thus exhausted ourselves rather than this wonderful
child, or angel rather, for he was as beautiful and
lovely in countenance as in knowledge, we concluded with
asking him if, in all he had read or heard of, he had
ever met with anything which was like this expedition of
the Prince of Orange, with so small a force to obtain
three great kingdoms without any contest. After a little
thought, he told us that he knew of nothing which did
more resemble it than the coming of Constantine the
Great out of Britain, through France and Italy, so tedious
a march, to meet Maxentius, whom he overthrew at
Pons Milvius with very little conflict, and at the very
gates of Rome, which he entered and was received with
triumph, and obtained the empire, not of three kingdoms
only, but of all the then known world. He was
perfect in the Latin authors, spoke French naturally,
and gave us a description of France, Italy, Savoy, Spain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
ancient and modernly divided; as also of ancient Greece,
Scythia, and northern countries and tracts: we left questioning
further. He did this without any set or formal
repetitions, as one who had learned things without book,
but as if he minded other things, going about the room,
and toying with a parrot there, and as he was at dinner
(<i>tanquam aliua agens</i>, as it were) seeming to be full
of play, of a lively, sprightly temper, always smiling,
and exceedingly pleasant, without the least levity, rudeness,
or childishness.</p>

<p>His father assured us he never imposed anything to
charge his memory by causing him to get things by
heart, not even the rules of grammar; but his tutor
(who was a Frenchman) read to him, first in French,
then in Latin; that he usually played among other boys
four or five hours every day, and that he was as earnest
at his play as at his study. He was perfect in arithmetic,
and now newly entered into Greek. In sum (<i>horresco
referens</i>), I had read of divers forward and precocious
youths, and some I have known, but I never did either
hear or read of anything like to this sweet child, if it be
right to call him child who has more knowledge than
most men in the world. I counseled his father not to
set his heart too much on this jewel,</p>

<p class="centerquot">"<i>Immodicis brevis est Ã¦tas, et rara senectus,</i>"</p>

<p class="continue">as I myself learned by sad experience in my most dear
child Richard, many years since, who, dying before he
was six years old, was both in shape and countenance
and pregnancy of learning, next to a prodigy.</p>
