<p>I went across the Thames on the
ice, now become so thick as to bear not only streets of
booths, in which they roasted meat, and had divers shops
of wares, quite across as in a town, but coaches, carts,
and horses passed over. So I went from Westminster
stairs to Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop: where
I met my Lord Bruce, Sir George Wheeler, Colonel Cooke,
and several divines. After dinner and discourse with his
Grace till evening prayers, Sir George Wheeler and I
walked over the ice from Lambeth stairs to the Horse-ferry.</p>
