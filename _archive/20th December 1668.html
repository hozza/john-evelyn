<p>I dined with my Lord Cornbury,
at Clarendon House, now bravely furnished, especially
with the pictures of most of our ancient and
modern wits, poets, philosophers, famous and learned
Englishmen; which collection of the Chancellor's I much
commended, and gave his Lordship a catalogue of more
to be added.</p>
