<p>I heard and saw such exercises at
the election of scholars at Westminster School to be sent
to the University in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic,
in themes and extemporary verses, as wonderfully astonished
me in such youths, with such readiness and wit,
some of them not above twelve or thirteen years of age.
Pity it is, that what they attain here so ripely, they
either do not retain, or do not improve more considerably
when they come to be men, though many of them
do; and no less is to be blamed their odd pronouncing
of Latin, so that out of England none were able to understand,
or endure it. The examinants, or posers, were,
Dr. Duport, Greek Professor at Cambridge; Dr. Fell, Dean
of Christ Church, Oxford; Dr. Pierson; Dr. Allestree,
Dean of Westminster, and any that would.</p>
