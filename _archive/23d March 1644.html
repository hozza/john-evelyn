<p>We passed along the coast by a very
rocky and rugged way, which forced us to alight many
times before we came to Havre de Grace, where we lay
that night.</p>

<p>The next morning, we saw the citadel, strong and regular,
well stored with artillery and ammunition of all
sorts: the works furnished with fair brass cannon, having
a motto, <i>Ratio ultima Regum</i>. The allogements of the
garrison are uniform; a spacious place for drawing up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the soldiers, a pretty chapel, and a fair house for the
Governor. The Duke of Richelieu being now in the fort,
we went to salute him; who received us very civilly, and
commanded that we should be showed whatever we desired
to see. The citadel was built by the late Cardinal
de Richelieu, uncle of the present Duke, and may be
esteemed one of the strongest in France. The haven is
very capacious.</p>

<p>When we had done here, we embarked ourselves and
horses to pass to Honfleur, about four or five leagues
distant, where the Seine falls into the sea. It is a poor
fisher-town, remarkable for nothing so much as the odd,
yet useful habits which the good women wear, of bears'
and other skins, as of rugs at Dieppe, and all along these
maritime coasts.</p>
