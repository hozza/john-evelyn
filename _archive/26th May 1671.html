<p>The Earl of Bristol's house in Queen's
Street [Lincoln's Inn Fields] was taken for the Commissioners
of Trade and Plantations, and furnished with
rich hangings of the King's. It consisted of seven rooms
on a floor, with a long gallery, gardens, etc. This day
we met the Duke of Buckingham, Earl of Lauderdale,
Lord Culpeper, Sir George Carteret, Vice-Chamberlain,
and myself, had the oaths given us by the Earl of Sandwich,
our President. It was to advise and counsel his
Majesty, to the best of our abilities, for the well-governing
of his Foreign Plantations, etc., the form very little
differing from that given to the Privy Council. We then
took our places at the Board in the Council-Chamber, a
very large room furnished with atlases, maps, charts,
globes, etc. Then came the Lord Keeper, Sir Orlando
Bridgeman, Earl of Arlington, Secretary of State, Lord
Ashley, Mr. Treasurer, Sir John Trevor, the other Secretary,
Sir John Duncomb, Lord Allington, Mr. Grey,
son to the Lord Grey, Mr. Henry Broncher, Sir Humphrey
Winch, Sir John Finch, Mr. Waller, and Colonel
Titus, of the bedchamber, with Mr. Slingsby, Secretary
to the Council, and two Clerks of the Council, who had
all been sworn some days before. Being all set, our
Patent was read, and then the additional Patent, in
which was recited this new establishment; then, was delivered
to each a copy of the Patent, and of instructions:
after which, we proceeded to business.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing we did was, to settle the form of a
circular letter to the Governors of all his Majesty's Plantations
and Territories in the West Indies and Islands
thereof, to give them notice to whom they should apply
themselves on all occasions, and to render us an account
of their present state and government; but, what we
most insisted on was, to know the condition of New
England, which appearing to be very independent as to
their regard to Old England, or his Majesty, rich and
strong as they now were, there were great debates in
what style to write to them; for the condition of that
Colony was such, that they were able to contest with all
other Plantations about them, and there was fear of
their breaking from all dependence on this nation; his
Majesty, therefore, commended this affair more expressly.
We, therefore, thought fit, in the first place, to acquaint
ourselves as well as we could of the state of that place,
by some whom we heard of that were newly come from
thence, and to be informed of their present posture and
condition; some of our Council were for sending them a
menacing letter, which those who better understood the
peevish and touchy humor of that Colony, were utterly
against.</p>

<p>A letter was then read from Sir Thomas Modiford,
Governor of Jamaica; and then the Council broke up.</p>

<p>Having brought an action against one Cocke, for money
which he had received for me, it had been referred to an
arbitration by the recommendation of that excellent good
man, the Chief-Justice Hale,<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27_27">27</a> but, this not succeeding, I
went to advise with that famous lawyer, Mr. Jones, of
Gray's Inn, and, 27th of May, had a trial before Lord Chief
Justice Hale; and, after the lawyers had wrangled sufficiently,
it was referred to a new arbitration. This was
the very first suit at law that ever I had with any creature,
and oh, that it might be the last!</p>
