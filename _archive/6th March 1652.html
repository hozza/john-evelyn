<p>Saw the magnificent funeral of that
arch-rebel, Ireton, carried in pomp from Somerset House
to Westminster, accompanied with divers regiments of
soldiers, horse and foot; then marched the mourners,
General Cromwell (his father-in-law), his mock-parliament-men,
officers, and forty poor men in gowns, three
led horses in housings of black cloth, two led in black
velvet, and his charging horse, all covered over with embroidery
and gold, on crimson velvet; then the guidons, ensigns,
four heralds, carrying the arms of the State (as
they called it), namely, the red cross and Ireland, with the
casque, wreath, sword, spurs, etc.; next, a chariot canopied
of black velvet, and six horses, in which was the
corpse; the pall held up by the mourners on foot; the
mace and sword, with other marks of his charge in Ireland
(where he died of the plague), carried before in
black scarfs. Thus, in a grave pace, drums covered with
cloth, soldiers reversing their arms, they proceeded
through the streets in a very solemn manner. This Ireton
was a stout rebel, and had been very bloody to the
King's party, witness his severity at Colchester, when in
cold blood he put to death those gallant gentlemen, Sir
Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle. My cousin, R.
Fanshawe, came to visit me, and informed me of many
considerable affairs. Sir Henry Herbert presented me
with his brother, my Lord Cherbury's book, "<i>De Veritate</i>."</p>
