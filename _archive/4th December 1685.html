<p>Lord Sunderland was declared
President of the Council, and yet to hold his Secretary's
place. The forces disposed into several quarters through
the kingdom are very insolent, on which are great complaints.</p>

<p>Lord Brandon, tried for the late conspiracy, was condemned
and pardoned; so was Lord Grey, his accuser
and witness.</p>

<p>Persecution in France raging, the French insolently
visit our vessels, and take away the fugitive Protestants;
some escape in barrels.</p>
