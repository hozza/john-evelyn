<p>Went to London, on purpose to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
hear that excellent preacher, Dr. Jeremy Taylor, on Matt.
xiv. 17, showing what were the conditions of obtaining
eternal life; also, concerning abatements for unavoidable
infirmities, how cast on the accounts of the cross. On the
31st, I made a visit to Dr. Jeremy Taylor, to confer with
him about some spiritual matters, using him thenceforward
as my ghostly father. I beseech God Almighty to
make me ever mindful of, and thankful for, his heavenly
assistances!</p>
