<p>There dined this day at my
Lord's one Sir John Gaudy, a very handsome person,
but quite dumb, yet very intelligent by signs, and a
very fine painter; he was so civil and well bred, as it
was not possible to discern any imperfection in him.
His lady and children were also there, and he was at
church in the morning with us.</p>
