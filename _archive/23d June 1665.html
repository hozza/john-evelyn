<p>I dined with Sir Robert Paston, since
Earl of Yarmouth, and saw the Duke of Verneuille, base
brother to the Queen-Mother, a handsome old man, a
great hunter.</p>

<p>The Duke of York told us that, when we were in fight,
his dog sought out absolutely the very securest place in
all the vessel.â€”In the afternoon, I saw the pompous
reception and audience of El Conde de Molino, the Spanish
Ambassador, in the Banqueting-house, both their
Majesties sitting together under the canopy of state.</p>
