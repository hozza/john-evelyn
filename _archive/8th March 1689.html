<p>Dr. Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury,
made an excellent discourse on Matt. v. 44, exhorting to
charity and forgiveness of enemies; I suppose purposely,
the new Parliament being furious about impeaching those
who were obnoxious, and as their custom has ever been,
going on violently, without reserve, or modification, while
wise men were of opinion the most notorious offenders
being named and excepted, an Act of Amnesty would be
more seasonable, to pacify the minds of men in so general
a discontent of the nation, especially of those who did not
expect to see the government assumed without any regard
to the absent King, or proving a spontaneous abdication,
or that the birth of the Prince of Wales was an imposture;
five of the Bishops also still refusing to take the
new oath.</p>

<p>In the meantime, to gratify the people, the hearth-tax
was remitted forever; but what was intended to supply it,
besides present great taxes on land, is not named.</p>

<p>The King abroad was now furnished by the French
King with money and officers for an expedition to Ireland.
The great neglect in not more timely preventing that
from hence, and the disturbances in Scotland, give apprehensions
of great difficulties, before any settlement can be
perfected here, while the Parliament dispose of the great
offices among themselves. The Great Seal, Treasury and
Admiralty put into commission of many unexpected
persons, to gratify the more; so that by the present
appearance of things (unless God Almighty graciously
interpose and give success in Ireland and settle Scotland)
more trouble seems to threaten the nation than
could be expected. In the interim, the new King refers
all to the Parliament in the most popular manner, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
is very slow in providing against all these menaces,
besides finding difficulties in raising men to send abroad;
the former army, which had never seen any service
hitherto, receiving their pay and passing their summer in
an idle scene of a camp at Hounslow, unwilling to engage,
and many disaffected, and scarce to be trusted.</p>
