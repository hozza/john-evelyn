<p>A frosty and dry season continued;
many persons die of apoplexy, more than usual. Lord
Marlborough, Lieutenant-General of the King's army in
England, gentleman of the bedchamber, etc., dismissed
from all his charges, military and other, for his excessive
taking of bribes, covetousness, and extortion on all occasions
from his inferior officers. Note, this was the Lord
who was entirely advanced by King James, and was the
first who betrayed and forsook his master. He was son
of Sir Winston Churchill of the Greencloth.</p>
