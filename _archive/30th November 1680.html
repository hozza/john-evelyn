<p>The anniversary election at the
Royal Society brought me to London, where was chosen
President that excellent person and great philosopher,
Mr. Robert Boyle, who indeed ought to have been the
very first; but neither his infirmity nor his modesty
could now any longer excuse him. I desired I might for
this year be left out of the Council, by reason my dwelling
was in the country. The Society according to custom
dined together.</p>

<p>The signal day begun the trial (at which I was present)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of my Lord Viscount Stafford, (for conspiring the death
of the King), second son to my Lord Thomas Howard,
Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshal of England,
and grandfather to the present Duke of Norfolk, whom
I so well knew, and from which excellent person I received
so many favors. It was likewise his birthday,
The trial was in Westminster Hall, before the King,
Lords, and Commons, just in the same manner as, forty
years past, the great and wise Earl of Strafford (there
being but one letter differing their names) received
his trial for pretended ill government in Ireland, in the
very same place, this Lord Stafford's father being then
High Steward. The place of sitting was now exalted
some considerable height from the paved floor of the
hall, with a stage of boards. The throne, woolsacks for
the Judges, long forms for the Peers, chair for the Lord
Steward, exactly ranged, as in the House of Lords. The
sides on both hands scaffolded to the very roof for the
members of the House of Commons. At the upper end,
and on the right side of the King's state, was a box for
his Majesty, and on the left others for the great ladies,
and over head a gallery for ambassadors and public ministers.
At the lower end, or entrance, was a bar, and place
for the prisoner, the Lieutenant of the Tower of London,
the ax-bearer and guards, my Lord Stafford's two daughters,
the Marchioness of Winchester being one; there was likewise
a box for my Lord to retire into. At the right
hand, in another box, somewhat higher, stood the witnesses;
at the left, the managers, in the name of the
Commons of England, namely, Serjeant Maynard (the
great lawyer, the same who prosecuted the cause against
the Earl of Strafford forty years before, being now near
eighty years of age), Sir William Jones, late Attorney-General,
Sir Francis Winnington, a famous pleader, and
Mr. Treby, now Recorder of London, not appearing in
their gowns as lawyers, but in their cloaks and swords,
as representing the Commons of England: to these were
joined Mr. Hampden, Dr. Sacheverell, Mr. Poule, Colonel
Titus, Sir Thomas Lee, all gentlemen of quality, and
noted parliamentary men. The first two days, in which
were read the commission and impeachment, were but a
tedious entrance into matter of fact, at which I was but
little present. But, on Thursday, I was commodiously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
seated among the Commons, when the witnesses were
sworn and examined. The principal witnesses were Mr.
Oates (who called himself Dr.), Mr. Dugdale, and Turberville.
Oates swore that he delivered a commission to
Viscount Stafford from the Pope, to be Paymaster-General
to an army intended to be raised; Dugdale, that
being at Lord Aston's, the prisoner dealt with him plainly
to murder his Majesty; and Turberville, that at Paris he
also proposed the same to him.</p>
