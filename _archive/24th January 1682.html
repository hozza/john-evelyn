<p>To the Royal Society, where at
the Council we passed a new law for the more accurate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
consideration of candidates, as whether they would really
be useful; also concerning the honorary members, that
none should be admitted but by diploma.</p>

<p>This evening I was at the entertainment of the Morocco
Ambassador at the Duchess of Portsmouth's glorious
apartments at Whitehall, where was a great banquet
of sweetmeats and music; but at which both the Ambassador
and his retinue behaved themselves with extraordinary
moderation and modesty, though placed about
a long table, a lady between two Moors, and among
these were the King's natural children, namely, Lady
Lichfield and Sussex, the Duchess of Portsmouth, Nelly,
etc., concubines, and cattle of that sort, as splendid as
jewels and excess of bravery could make them; the
Moors neither admiring nor seeming to regard anything,
furniture or the like, with any earnestness, and but decently
tasting of the banquet. They drank a little milk
and water, but not a drop of wine; they also drank of
a sorbet and jacolatt;<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_45_45">45</a> did not look about, or stare on
the ladies, or express the least surprise, but with a
courtly negligence in pace, countenance, and whole behavior,
answering only to such questions as were asked
with a great deal of wit and gallantry, and so gravely
took leave with this compliment, that God would bless
the Duchess of Portsmouth and the Prince, her son
meaning the little Duke of Richmond. The King came
in at the latter end, just as the Ambassador was going
away. In this manner was this slave (for he was no
more at home) entertained by most of the nobility in
town, and went often to Hyde Park on horseback, where
he and his retinue showed their extraordinary activity in
horsemanship, and flinging and catching their lances at
full speed; they rode very short, and could stand upright
at full speed, managing their spears with incredible
agility. He went sometimes to the theaters, where, upon
any foolish or fantastical action, he could not forbear
laughing, but he endeavored to hide it with extraordinary
modesty and gravity. In a word, the Russian Ambassador,
still at Court behaved himself like a clown
compared to this civil heathen.</p>
