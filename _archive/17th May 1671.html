<p>Dined at Mr. Treasurer's [Sir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Thomas Clifford] with the Earl of Arlington, Carlingford,
Lord Arundel of Wardour, Lord Almoner to the
Queen, a French Count and two abbots, with several
more of French nobility; and now by something I had
lately observed of Mr. Treasurer's conversation on occasion,
I suspected him a little warping to Rome.</p>
