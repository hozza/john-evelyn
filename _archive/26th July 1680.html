<p>My most noble and illustrious friend,
the Earl of Ossory, espying me this morning after sermon
in the privy gallery, calling to me, told me he was
now going his journey (meaning to Tangier, whither he
was designed Governor, and General of the forces, to
regain the losses we had lately sustained from the Moors,
when Inchiquin was Governor). I asked if he would
not call at my house (as he always did whenever he went
out of England on any exploit). He said he must embark
at Portsmouth, "wherefore let you and me dine together
to-day; I am quite alone, and have something to
impart to you; I am not well, shall be private, and desire
your company."</p>

<p>Being retired to his lodgings, and set down on a couch,
he sent to his secretary for the copy of a letter which he
had written to Lord Sunderland (Secretary of State),
wishing me to read it; it was to take notice how ill he
resented it, that he should tell the King before Lord
Ossory's face, that Tangier was not to be kept, but would
certainly be lost, and yet added that it was fit Lord
Ossory should be sent, that they might give some account
of it to the world, meaning (as supposed) the
next Parliament, when all such miscarriages would probably
be examined; this Lord Ossory took very ill of Lord
Sunderland, and not kindly of the King, who resolving to
send him with an incompetent force, seemed, as his
Lordship took it, to be willing to cast him away, not
only on a hazardous adventure, but in most men's opinion,
an impossibility, seeing there was not to be above
300 or 400 horse, and 4,000 foot for the garrison and all,
both to defend the town, form a camp, repulse the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and fortify what ground they should get in. This touched
my Lord deeply, that he should be so little considered
as to put him on a business in which he should probably
not only lose his reputation, but be charged with all the
miscarriage and ill success; whereas, at first they promised
6,000 foot and 600 horse effective.</p>

<p>My Lord, being an exceedingly brave and valiant person,
and who had so approved himself in divers signal battles,
both at sea and land; so beloved and so esteemed by the
people, as one they depended on, upon all occasions worthy
of such a captain;â€”he looked on this as too great an
indifference in his Majesty, after all his services, and the
merits of his father, the Duke of Ormond, and a design
of some who envied his virtue. It certainly took so deep
root in his mind, that he who was the most void of fear
in the world (and assured me he would go to Tangier with
ten men if his Majesty commanded him) could not bear
up against this unkindness. Having disburdened himself
of this to me after dinner, he went with his Majesty to
the sheriffs at a great supper in Fishmongers' Hall; but
finding himself ill, took his leave immediately of his
Majesty, and came back to his lodging. Not resting well
this night, he was persuaded to remove to Arlington
House, for better accommodation. His disorder turned
to a malignant fever, which increasing, after all that six
of the most able physicians could do, he became delirious,
with intervals of sense, during which Dr. Lloyd (after
Bishop of St. Asaph) administered the Holy Sacrament,
of which I also participated. He died the Friday following,
the 30th of July, to the universal grief of all that
knew or heard of his great worth, nor had any a greater
loss than myself. Oft would he say I was the oldest
acquaintance he had in England (when his father was in
Ireland), it being now of about thirty years, contracted
abroad, when he rode in the Academy in Paris, and when
we were seldom asunder.</p>

<p>His Majesty never lost a worthier subject, nor father a
better or more dutiful son; a loving, generous, good-natured,
and perfectly obliging friend; one who had done
innumerable kindnesses to several before they knew it;
nor did he ever advance any that were not worthy; no
one more brave, more modest; none more humble, sober,
and every way virtuous. Unhappy England in this illus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>trious
person's loss! Universal was the mourning for
him, and the eulogies on him; I stayed night and day by
his bedside to his last gasp, to close his dear eyes! O
sad father, mother, wife, and children! What shall I add?
He deserved all that a sincere friend, a brave soldier, a
virtuous courtier, a loyal subject, an honest man, a
bountiful master, and good Christian, could deserve of his
prince and country. One thing more let me note, that
he often expressed to me the abhorrence he had of that
base and unworthy action which he was put upon, of engaging
the Smyrna fleet in time of peace, in which though
he behaved himself like a great captain, yet he told me
it was the only blot in his life, and troubled him exceedingly.
Though he was commanded, and never examined
further when he was so, yet he always spoke of it
with regret and detestation. The Countess was at the
seat of her daughter, the Countess of Derby, about 200
miles off.</p>
