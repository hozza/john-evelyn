<p>I set out to meet her now on her
journey from Paris, after she had obtained leave to come
out of that city, which had now been besieged some
time by the Prince of <a id="tn_png_306"></a><!--TN: "Condè's" changed to "Condé's"-->Condé's army in the time of the
rebellion, and after she had been now near twelve years
from her own country, that is, since five years of age,
at which time she went over. I went to Rye to meet
her, where was an embargo on occasion of the late conflict
with the Holland fleet, the two nations being now
in war, and which made sailing very unsafe.</p>

<p>On Whit Sunday, I went to the church (which is a very
fair one), and heard one of the canters, who dismissed
the assembly rudely, and without any blessing. Here I
stayed till the 10th with no small impatience, when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
walked over to survey the ruins of Winchelsea, that ancient
cinq-port, which by the remains and ruins of ancient
streets and public structures, discovers it to have been
formerly a considerable and large city. There are to be
seen vast caves and vaults, walls and towers, ruins of
monasteries and of a sumptuous church, in which are
some handsome monuments, especially of the Templars,
buried just in the manner of those in the Temple at
London. This place being now all in rubbish, and a few
despicable hovels and cottages only standing, hath yet a
Mayor. The sea, which formerly rendered it a rich and
commodious port, has now forsaken it.</p>
