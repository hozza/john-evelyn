<p>My only remaining son died after a
tedious languishing sickness, contracted in Ireland, and
increased here, to my exceeding grief and affliction; leaving
me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I pray God
to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family.
He was aged forty-four years and about three months.
He had been six years one of the Commissioners of the
Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and reputation.</p>
