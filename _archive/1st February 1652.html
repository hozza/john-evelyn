<p>I dined at Abbeville; 2d, dined at
Montreuil, lay at Boulogne; 3d, came to Calais, by eleven
in the morning; I thought to have embarked in the evening,
but, for fear of pirates plying near the coast, I dared
not trust our small vessel, and stayed till Monday following,
when two or three lusty vessels were to depart.</p>

<p>I brought with me from Paris Mr. Christopher Wase,
sometime before made to resign his Fellowship in King's
College, Cambridge, because he would not take the Covenant.
He had been a soldier in Flanders, and came
miserable to Paris. From his excellent learning, and
some relation he had to Sir R. Browne, I bore his charges
into England, and clad and provided for him, till he
should find some better condition; and he was worthy of
it. There came with us also Captain Griffith, Mr. Tyrell,
brother to Sir Timothy Tyrell, of Shotover (near Oxford).</p>

<p>At Calais, I dined with my Lord Wentworth, and met
with Mr. Heath, Sir Richard Lloyd, Captain Paine, and
divers of our banished friends, of whom understanding
that the Count de la Strade, Governor of Dunkirk, was
in the town, who had bought my wife's picture, taken by
pirates at sea the year before (my wife having sent it
for me in England), as my Lord of Norwich had informed
me at Paris, I made my address to him, who frankly told
me that he had such a picture in his own bedchamber
among other ladies, and how he came by it; seeming
well pleased that it was his fortune to preserve it for me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
and he generously promised to send it to any friend I
had at Dover; I mentioned a French merchant there and
so took my leave.</p>
