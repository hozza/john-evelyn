<p>At a Council of the Royal Society
our grant was finished, in which his Majesty gives us
Chelsea College, and some land about it. It was ordered
that five should be a quorum for a Council. The Vice-President
was then sworn for the first time, and it was
proposed how we should receive the Prince of Tuscany,
who desired to visit the Society.</p>
