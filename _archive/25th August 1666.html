<p>Waited on Sir William D'Oyly, now
recovered, as it were, miraculously. In the afternoon, visited
the Savoy Hospital, where I stayed to see the miserably
dismembered and wounded men dressed, and gave some
necessary orders. Then to my Lord Chancellor, who had,
with the Bishop of London and others in the commission,
chosen me one of the three surveyors of the repairs of
Paul's, and to consider of a model for the new building,
or, if it might be, repairing of the steeple, which was most
decayed.</p>
