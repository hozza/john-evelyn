<p>This day was read in our church
the Brief for a collection for relief of the Protestant
French so cruelly, barbarously, and inhumanly oppressed
without any thing being laid to their charge. It had
been long expected, and at last with difficulty procured
to be published, the interest of the French Ambassador
obstructing it.</p>
