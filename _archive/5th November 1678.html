<p>Dr. Tillotson preached before the
Commons at St. Margaret's. He said the Papists were
now arrived at that impudence, as to deny that there
ever was any such as the gunpowder-conspiracy; but he
affirmed that he himself had several letters written by
Sir Everard Digby (one of the traitors), in which he
gloried that he was to suffer for it; and that it was so
contrived, that of the Papists not above two or three
should have been blown up, and they, such as were not
worth saving.</p>
