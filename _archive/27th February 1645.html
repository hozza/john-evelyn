<p>In the morning Mr. Henshaw
and myself walked to the Trophies of Marius, erected in
honor of his victory over the Cimbrians, but these now
taken out of their niches are placed on the balusters of
the Capitol, so that their ancient station is now a ruin.
Keeping on our way, we came to St. Croce of Jerusalem,
built by Constantine over the demolition of the
Temple of Venus and Cupid, which he threw down; and
it was here, they report, he deposited the wood of the
true Cross, found by his mother, Helena; in honor
whereof this church was built, and in memory of his victory
over Maxentius when that holy sign appeared to
him. The edifice without is Gothic, but very glorious
within, especially the roof, and one tribuna (gallery)
well painted. Here is a chapel dedicated to St. Helena,
the floor whereof is of earth brought from Jerusalem;
the walls are of fair mosaic, in which they suffer no
women to enter, save once a year. Under the high altar
of the Church is buried St. Anastasius, in Lydian marble,
and Benedict VII.; and they show a number of relics,
exposed at our request; with a phial of our blessed Savior's
blood; two thorns of his crown; three chips of
the real cross; one of the nails, wanting a point; St.
Thomas's doubting finger; and a fragment of the title (put
on the cross), being part of a thin board; some of Judas's
pieces of silver; and many more, if one had faith to believe
it. To this venerable church joins a Monastery, the
gardens taking up the space of an ancient amphitheatre.</p>

<p>Hence, we passed beyond the walls out at the Port of
St. Laurence, to that Saint's church, and where his ashes
are enshrined. This was also built by the same great
Constantine, famous for the Coronation of Pietro Altissiodorensis,
Emperor of Constantinople, by Honorius II.
It is said the corpse of St. Stephen, the proto martyr,
was deposited here by that of St. Sebastian, which it
had no sooner touched, but Sebastian gave it place of
its own accord. The Church has no less than seven
privileged altars, and excellent pictures. About the walls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
are painted this martyr's sufferings; and, when they built
them, the bones of divers saints were translated to other
churches. The front is Gothic. In our return, we saw a
small ruin of an aqueduct built by Quintus Marcius,
the prætor; and so passed through that incomparable
straight street leading to Santa Maria Maggiore, to our
lodging, sufficiently tired.</p>

<p>We were taken up next morning in seeing the impertinences
of the Carnival, when all the world are as mad
at Rome as at other places; but the most remarkable
were the three races of the Barbary horses, that run in
the Strada del Corso without riders, only having spurs so
placed on their backs, and hanging down by their sides,
as by their motion to stimulate them: then of mares, then
of asses, of buffalos, naked men, old and young, and
boys, and abundance of idle ridiculous pastime. One
thing is remarkable, their acting comedies on a stage
placed on a cart, or <i>plaustrum</i>, where the scene, or tiring
place, is made of boughs in a rural manner, which
they drive from street to street with a yoke or two of
oxen, after the ancient guise. The streets swarm with
prostitutes, buffoons, and all manner of rabble.</p>
