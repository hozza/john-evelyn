<p>His Majesty began first to <span style="font-size:.8em;">TOUCH FOR
THE EVIL!</span> according to custom, thus: his Majesty sitting
under his state in the banqueting house, the chirurgeons
cause the sick to be brought, or led, up to the throne,
where they kneeling, the King strokes their faces, or
cheeks with both his hands at once, at which instant a
chaplain in his formalities says, "He put his hands upon
them, and he healed them." This is said to every one
in particular. When they have all been touched, they
come up again in the same order, and the other chaplain
kneeling, and having angel gold<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_63_63">63</a> strung on white ribbon
on his arm, delivers them one by one to his Majesty,
who puts them about the necks of the touched as they
pass, while the first chaplain repeats, "That is the true
light who came into the world." Then follows, an Epistle
(as at first a Gospel) with the Liturgy, prayers for the
sick, with some alteration; lastly the blessing; and then
the Lord Chamberlain and the Comptroller of the Household
bring a basin, ewer, and towel, for his Majesty to
wash.</p>

<p>The King received a congratulatory address from the
city of Cologne, in Germany, where he had been some
time in his exile; his Majesty saying they were the best
people in the world, the most kind and worthy to him
that he ever met with.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
I recommended Monsieur Messary to be Judge Advocate
in Jersey, by the Vice-Chamberlain's mediation
with the Earl of St. Albans; and saluted my excellent
and worthy noble friend, my Lord Ossory, son to the Marquis
of Ormond, after many years' absence returned home.</p>
