<p>We departed and dined at a farm
of my Uncle Hungerford's, called Darnford Magna, situated
in a valley under the plain, most sweetly watered,
abounding in trouts caught by spear in the night,
when they come attracted by a light set in the stern of a boat.</p>

<p>After dinner, continuing our return, we passed over the
goodly plain, or rather sea of carpet, which I think for
evenness, extent, verdure, and innumerable flocks, to be
one of the most delightful prospects in nature, and
reminded me of the pleasant lives of shepherds we read
of in romances.</p>

<p>Now we arrived at Stonehenge, indeed a stupendous
monument, appearing at a distance like a castle; how so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
many and huge pillars of stone should have been brought
together, some erect, others transverse on the tops of
them, in a circular area as rudely representing a cloister
or heathen and more natural temple, is wonderful.
The stone is so exceedingly hard, that all my strength
with a hammer could not break a fragment; which hardness
I impute to their so long exposure. To number
them exactly is very difficult, they lie in such variety
of postures and confusion, though they seemed not to
exceed 100; we counted only 95. As to their being
brought thither, there being no navigable river near, is
by some admired; but for the stone, there seems to be
the same kind about 20 miles distant, some of which appear
above ground. About the same hills, are divers
mounts raised, conceived to be ancient intrenchments, or
places of burial, after bloody fights. We now went by
Devizes, a reasonable large town, and came late to Cadenham.</p>
