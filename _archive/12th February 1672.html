<p>At the Council, we entered on
inquiries about improving the plantations by silks, galls,
flax, senna, etc., and considered how nutmegs and cinnamon
might be obtained and brought to Jamaica, that soil
and climate promising success. Dr. Worsley being called
in, spoke many considerable things to encourage it. We
took order to send to the plantations, that none of their ships
should adventure homeward single, but stay for company
and convoys. We also deliberated on some fit person to
go as commissioner to inspect their actions in New England,
and, from time to time, report how that people stood
affected. In future, to meet at Whitehall.</p>
