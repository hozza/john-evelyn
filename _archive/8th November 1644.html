<p>We visited the Jesuits' Church,
the front whereof is esteemed a noble piece of architecture,
the design of Jacomo della Porta and the famous
Vignola. In this church lies the body of their renowned
Ignatius Loyola, an arm of Xaverius, their other Apostle;
and, at the right end of their high altar, their champion,
Cardinal Bellarmine. Here Father Kircher (professor
of Mathematics and the oriental tongues) showed us many
singular courtesies, leading us into their refectory, dispensatory,
laboratory, gardens, and finally (through a
hall hung round with pictures of such of their order as
had been executed for their pragmatical and busy adventures)
into his own study, where, with Dutch patience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
he showed us his perpetual motions, catoptrics, magnetical
experiments, models, and a thousand other crotchets
and devices, most of them since published by himself,
or his industrious scholar, Schotti.</p>

<p>Returning home, we had time to view the Palazzo de
Medicis, which was an house of the Duke of Florence
near our lodging, upon the brow of Mons Pincius, having
a fine prospect toward the Campo Marzo. It is a
magnificent, strong building, with a substruction very
remarkable, and a portico supported with columns toward
the gardens, with two huge lions, of marble, at
the end of the balustrade. The whole outside of the
<i>facciata</i> is incrusted with antique and rare basso-relievos
and statues. Descending into the garden is a noble fountain
governed by a Mercury of brass. At a little distance,
on the left, is a lodge full of fine statues, among
which the Sabines, antique and singularly rare. In the
arcade near this stand twenty-four statues of great price,
and hard by is a mount planted with cypresses, representing
a fortress, with a goodly fountain in the middle.
Here is also a row balustred with white marble,
covered over with the natural shrubs, ivy, and other
perennial greens, divers statues and heads being placed
as in niches. At a little distance are those famed statues
of Niobe and her family, in all fifteen, as large as
the life, of which we have ample mention in Pliny, esteemed
among the best pieces of work in the world for
the passions they express, and all other perfections of
that stupendous art. There is likewise in this garden a
fair obelisk, full of hieroglyphics. In going out, the
fountain before the front casts water near fifty feet in
height, when it is received in a most ample marble basin.
Here they usually rode the great horse every morning;
which gave me much diversion from the terrace of my
own chamber, where I could see all their motions. This
evening, I was invited to hear rare music at the Chiesa
Nova; the black marble pillars within led us to that
most precious oratory of Philippus Nerius, their founder;
they being of the oratory of secular priests, under no
vow. There are in it divers good pictures, as the Assumption
of Girolamo Mutiano; the Crucifix; the Visitation
of Elizabeth; the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin;
Christo Sepolto, of Guido Rheno, Caravaggio, Arpino, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
others. This fair church consists of fourteen altars, and
as many chapels. In it is buried (besides their Saint)
CÃ¦sar Baronius, the great annalist. Through this, we
went into the <i>sacristia</i>, where, the tapers being lighted,
one of the Order preached; after him stepped up a child
of eight or nine years old, who pronounced an oration
with so much grace, that I never was better pleased
than to hear Italian so well and so intelligently spoken.
This course it seems they frequently use, to bring their
scholars to a habit of speaking distinctly, and forming
their action and assurance, which none so much want as
ours in England. This being finished, began their <i>motettos</i>,
which in a lofty cupola richly painted, were sung by
eunuchs, and other rare voices, accompanied by <a id="tn_png_134"></a><!--TN: "theorboes" changed to "theorbos"-->theorbos,
harpsichords, and viols, so that we were even ravished
with the entertainment of the evening. This room
is painted by Cortona, and has in it two figures in the
niches, and the church stands in one of the most stately
streets of Rome.</p>
