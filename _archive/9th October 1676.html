<p>I went with Mrs. Godolphin and
my wife to Blackwall, to see some Indian curiosities; the
streets being slippery, I fell against a piece of timber
with such violence that I could not speak nor fetch my
breath for some space; being carried into a house and
let blood, I was removed to the water-side and so home,
where, after a day's rest, I recovered. This being one of
my greatest deliverances, the Lord Jesus make me ever
mindful and thankful!</p>
