<p>I took coach, to see a general
muster of all the <i>gens d'armes</i> about the city, in the Bois
de Boulogne, before their Majesties and all the Grandees.
They were reputed to be near 20,000, besides the spectators,
who much exceeded them in number. Here they
performed all their motions; and, being drawn up, horse
and foot, into several figures, represented a battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORLEANS</div>

<p>The summer now drawing near, I determined to spend
the rest of it in some more remote town on the river
Loire; and, on 19th of April, I took leave of Paris, and, by
the way of the messenger, agreed for my passage to Orleans.</p>

<p>The way from Paris to this city, as indeed most of the
roads in France, is paved with a small square freestone,
so that the country does not much molest the traveler
with dirt and ill way, as in England, only 'tis somewhat
hard to the poor horses' feet, which causes them to ride
more temperately, seldom going out of the trot, or <i>grand
pas</i>, as they call it. We passed divers walled towns, or
villages; among others of note, Chartres and Etampes,
where we lay the first night. This has a fair church. The
next day, we had an excellent road; but had liked to
come short home: for no sooner were we entered two or
three leagues into the Forest of Orleans (which extends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
itself many miles), but the company behind us were set
on by rogues, who, shooting from the hedges and frequent
covert, slew four upon the spot. Among the slain
was a captain of Swiss, of the regiment of Picardy, a
person much lamented. This disaster made such an
alarm in Orleans at our arrival, that the Prevôt Marshal,
with his assistants, going in pursuit, brought in two
whom they had shot, and exposed them in the great
market place, to see if any would take cognizance of
them. I had great cause to give God thanks for this
escape; when coming to Orleans and lying at the White
Cross, I found Mr. John Nicholas, eldest son to Mr.
Secretary. In the night a cat kittened on my bed, and
left on it a young one having six ears, eight legs, two
bodies from the middle downward, and two tails. I found
it dead, but warm, in the morning when I awaked.</p>
