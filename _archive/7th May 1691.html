<p>I went to visit the Archbishop of
Canterbury [Sancroft] yet at Lambeth. I found him
alone, and discoursing of the times, especially of the newly
designed Bishops; he told me that by no canon or divine
law they could justify the removing of the present incumbents;
that Dr. Beveridge, designed Bishop of Bath and
Wells, came to ask his advice; that the Archbishop told
him, though he should give it, he believed he would not
take it; the Doctor said he would; why then, says the
Archbishop, when they come to ask, say "<i>Nolo</i>," and say
it from the heart; there is nothing easier than to resolve
yourself what is to be done in the case: the Doctor
seemed to deliberate. What he will do I know not, but
Bishop Ken, who is to be put out, is exceedingly beloved
in his diocese; and, if he and the rest should insist on
it, and plead their interest as freeholders, it is believed
there would be difficulty in their case, and it may endanger
a schism and much disturbance, so as wise men think
it had been better to have let them alone, than to have
proceeded with this rigor to turn them out for refusing
to swear against their consciences. I asked at parting,
when his Grace removed; he said that he had not yet
received any summons, but I found the house altogether
disfurnished and his books packed up.</p>
