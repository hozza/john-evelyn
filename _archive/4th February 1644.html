<p>I went to see the Marais de
Temple, where are a noble church and palace, heretofore
dedicated to the Knights Templar, now converted to a
piazza, not much unlike ours at Covent Garden; but large
and not so pleasant, though built all about with divers
considerable palaces.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Geneviève is a place of great devotion,
dedicated to another of their Amazons, said to have
delivered the city from the English; for which she is
esteemed the tutelary saint of Paris. It stands on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
steep eminence, having a very high spire, and is governed
by canons regular. At the Palais Royal Henry IV. built
a fair quadrangle of stately palaces, arched underneath.
In the middle of a spacious area, stands on a noble
pedestal a brazen statue of Louis XIII., which, though
made in imitation of that in the Roman capitol, is
nothing so much esteemed as that on the Pont Neuf.</p>

<p>The hospital of the Quinze-Vingts, in the Rue St.
Honoré, is an excellent foundation; but above all is the
Hôtel Dieu for men and women, near Nôtre Dame, a
princely, pious, and expensive structure. That of the
Charité gave me great satisfaction, in seeing how decently
and christianly the sick people are attended, even to delicacy.
I have seen them served by noble persons, men and
women. They have also gardens, walks, and fountains.
Divers persons are here cut for the stone, with great
success, yearly in May. The two Châtelets (supposed to
have been built by Julius Cæsar) are places of judicature
in criminal causes; to which is a strong prison. The
courts are spacious and magnificent.</p>
