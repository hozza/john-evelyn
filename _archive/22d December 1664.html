<p>I went to the launching of a new
ship of two bottoms, invented by Sir William Petty, on
which were various opinions; his Majesty being present,
gave her the name of the "Experiment": so I returned
home, where I found Sir Humphry Winch, who spent the
day with me.</p>

<p>This year I planted the lower grove next the pond at
Sayes Court. It was now exceedingly cold, and a hard,
long, frosty season, and the comet was very visible.</p>
