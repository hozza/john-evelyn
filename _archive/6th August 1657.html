<p>I went to see Colonel Blount, who
showed me the application of the waywiser<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_58_58">58</a> to a coach,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
exactly measuring the miles, and showing them by an
index as we went on. It had three circles, one pointing
to the number of rods, another to the miles, by 10 to
1,000, with all the subdivisions of quarters; very pretty
and useful.</p>
