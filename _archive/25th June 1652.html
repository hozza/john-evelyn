<p>After a drought of near four months,
there fell so violent a tempest of hail, rain, wind, thunder,
and lightning, as no man had seen the like in his
age; the hail being in some places four or five inches
about, broke all glass about London, especially at Deptford,
and more at Greenwich.</p>
