<p>I went to London, where I
found the Court in the utmost consternation on report
of the Prince of Orange's landing; which put Whitehall
into so panic a fear, that I could hardly believe it possible
to find such a change.</p>

<p>Writs were issued in order to a Parliament, and a declaration
to back the good order of elections, with great
professions of maintaining the Church of England, but
without giving any sort of satisfaction to the people, who
showed their high discontent at several things in the
Government.</p>

<p>Earthquakes had utterly demolished the ancient Smyrna,
and several other places in Greece, Italy, and even in
the Spanish Indies, forerunners of greater calamities.
God Almighty preserve his Church and all who put
themselves under the shadow of his wings, till these
things be overpassed.</p>
