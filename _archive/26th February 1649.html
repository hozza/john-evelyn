<p>Came to see me Captain George
Evelyn, my kinsman, the great traveler, and one who
believed himself a better architect than really he was;
witness the portico in the Garden at Wotton; yet the
great room at Albury is somewhat better understood.
He had a large mind, but over-built everything.</p>
