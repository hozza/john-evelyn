<p>I sat on the commission for Charitable
Uses, the Lord Mayor and others of the Mercers'
Company being summoned, to answer some complaints
of the Professors, grounded on a clause in the will of
Sir Thomas Gresham, the founder.</p>

<p>This afternoon, the Queen-Mother, with the Earl of
St. Alban's and many great ladies and persons, was
pleased to honor my poor villa with her presence, and
to accept of a collation. She was exceedingly pleased,
and staid till very late in the evening.</p>
