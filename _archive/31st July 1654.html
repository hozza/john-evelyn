<p>Taking leave of Cadenham, where we
had been long and nobly entertained, we went a compass
into Leicestershire, where dwelt another relation of
my wife's; for I indeed made these excursions to
show her the most considerable parts of her native
country, who, from her childhood, had lived altogether in
France, as well as for my own curiosity and information.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GLOUCESTER</div>

<p>About two miles before coming to Gloucester, we have
a prospect from woody hills into a most goodly vale and
country. Gloucester is a handsome city, considerable for
the church and monuments. The minster is indeed a
noble fabric. The whispering gallery is rare, being
through a passage of twenty-five yards in a many-angled
cloister, and was, I suppose, either to show the skill of
the architect, or some invention of a cunning priest, who,
standing unseen in a recess in the middle of the chapel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
might hear whatever was spoken at either end. This is
above the choir, in which lies buried King Stephen<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_50_50">50</a> under
a monument of Irish oak, not ill carved considering the
age. The new library is a noble though a private design.
I was likewise pleased with the Severn gliding so sweetly
by it. The Duke's house, the castle works, are now almost
quite dismantled; nor yet without sad thoughts did
I see the town, considering how fatal the siege had been
a few years before to our good King.</p>
