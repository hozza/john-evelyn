<p>The Queen arrived with a train of
Portuguese ladies in their monstrous fardingales, or
guard-infantes, their complexions olivader<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_70_70">70</a> and sufficiently
unagreeable. Her Majesty in the same habit, her foretop
long and turned aside very strangely. She was yet
of the handsomest countenance of all the rest, and,
though low of stature, prettily shaped, languishing and
excellent eyes, her teeth wronging her mouth by sticking
a little too far out; for the rest, lovely enough.</p>
