<p>I went home to visit my friends, and, on
the 26th, with my brother and sister to Lewes, where
we abode till the 31st; and thence to one Mr.Â Michael's, of
Houghton, near Arundel, where we were very well treated;
and, on the 2d of August, to Portsmouth, and thence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
having surveyed the fortifications (a great rarity in that
blessed halcyon time in England), we passed into the
Isle of Wight, to the house of my Lady Richards, in a
place called Yaverland; but were turned the following day
to Chichester, where, having viewed the city and fair
cathedral, we returned home.</p>

<p>About the beginning of September, I was so afflicted
with a quartan ague, that I could by no means get rid
of it till the December following. This was the fatal
year wherein the rebellious Scots opposed the King, upon
the pretense of the introduction of some new ceremonies
and the Book of Common Prayer, and madly began our
confusions, and their own destruction, too, as it proved
in event.</p>
