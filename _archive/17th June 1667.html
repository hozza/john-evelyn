<p>This night, about two o'clock, some
chips and combustible matter prepared for some fire-ships,
taking flame in Deptford-yard, made such a blaze,
and caused such an uproar in the Tower (it being given
out that the Dutch fleet was come up, and had landed
their men and fired the Tower), as had liked to have
done more mischief before people would be persuaded
to the contrary and believe the accident. Everybody
went to their arms. These were sad and troublesome times.</p>
