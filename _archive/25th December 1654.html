<p>Christmas day. No public offices
in churches, but penalties on observers, so as I was constrained
to celebrate it at home.</p>

<p>1st January, 1654-55. Having with my family performed
the public offices of the day, and begged a blessing on
the year I was now entering, I went to keep the rest of
Christmas at my brother's, R. Evelyn, at Woodcot.</p>
