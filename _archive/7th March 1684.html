<p>Dr. Meggot, Dean of Winchester,
preached an incomparable sermon (the King being now
gone to Newmarket), on Heb. xii. 15, showing and
pathetically pressing the care we ought to have lest we

visit Dr. Tenison at Kensington, whither he was retired
to refresh, after he had been sick of the smallpox.</p>
