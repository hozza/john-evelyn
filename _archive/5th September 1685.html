<p>I accompanied his Lordship to
Windsor (dining by the way of Sir Henry Capel's at
Kew), where his Majesty receiving me with extraordinary
kindness, I kissed his hand, I told him how sensible I
was of his Majesty's gracious favor to me, that I would
endeavor to serve him with all sincerity, diligence, and
loyalty, not more out of my duty than inclination.
He said he doubted not of it, and was glad he had the
opportunity to show me the kindness he had for me.
After this, came abundance of great men to give
me joy.</p>
