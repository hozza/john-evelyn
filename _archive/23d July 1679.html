<p>To Court: after dinner, I visited that
excellent painter, Verrio, whose works in <i>fresco</i> in the
King's palace, at Windsor, will celebrate his name as long
as those walls last. He showed us his pretty garden,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
choice flowers, and curiosities, he himself being a skillful
gardener.</p>

<p>I went to Clifden, that stupendous natural rock, wood,
and prospect, of the Duke of Buckingham's, and buildings
of extraordinary expense. The grots in the chalky rocks
are pretty: it is a romantic object, and the place altogether
answers the most poetical description that can be
made of solitude, precipice, prospect, or whatever can contribute
to a thing so very like their imaginations. The
stand, somewhat like Frascati as to its front, and on the
platform is a circular view to the utmost verge of the horizon,
which, with the serpenting of the Thames, is admirable.
The staircase is for its materials singular; the
cloisters, descents, gardens, and avenue through the wood,
august and stately; but the land all about wretchedly
barren, and producing nothing but fern. Indeed, as I
told his Majesty that evening (asking me how I liked
Clifden) without flattery, that it did not please me so well
as Windsor for the prospect and park, which is without
compare; there being but one only opening, and that
narrow, which led one to any variety; whereas that of
Windsor is everywhere great and unconfined.</p>

<p>Returning, I called at my cousin Evelyn's, who has a
very pretty seat in the forest, two miles by hither Clifden,
on a flat, with gardens exquisitely kept, though
large, and the house a staunch good old building, and
what was singular, some of the rooms floored dove tail-wise
without a nail, exactly close. One of the closets is
pargeted with plain deal, set in diamond, exceeding staunch
and pretty.</p>
