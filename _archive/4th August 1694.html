<p>I went to visit my cousin, George
Evelyn of Nutfield, where I found a family of ten children,
five sons and five daughtersâ€”all beautiful women
grown, and extremely well-fashioned. All painted in one
piece, very well, by Mr. Lutterell, in crayon on copper,
and seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.
They are the children of two extraordinary beautiful
wives. The boys were at school.</p>
