<p>Being in my garden at 6 o'clock in the
evening, and hearing the great guns go thick off, I took
horse and rode that night to Rochester; thence next day
toward the Downs and seacoast, but meeting the Lieutenant
of the Hampshire frigate, who told me what
passed, or rather what had not passed, I returned to London,
there being no noise, or appearance at Deal, or on
that coast of any engagement. Recounting this to his
Majesty, whom I found at St. James's Park, impatiently
expecting, and knowing that Prince Rupert was loose
about three at St. Helen's Point at N. of the Isle of
Wight, it greatly rejoiced him; but he was astonished
when I assured him they heard nothing of the guns in
the Downs, nor did the Lieutenant who landed there by
five that morning.</p>
