<p>I saw the tragedy of "Horace"
(written by the <span class="small">VIRTUOUS</span> Mrs. Philips) acted before their
Majesties. Between each act a masque and antique dance.
The excessive gallantry of the ladies was infinite, those
especially on that ... Castlemaine, esteemed at Â£40,000
and more, far outshining the Queen.</p>
