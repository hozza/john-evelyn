<p>I refused to put the Privy Seal to
Doctor Walker's license for printing and publishing divers
Popish books, of which I complained both to my Lord
of Canterbury (with whom I went to advise in the Council
Chamber), and to my Lord Treasurer that evening at
his lodgings. My Lord of Canterbury's advice was, that
I should follow my own conscience therein; Mr. Treasurer's,
that if in conscience I could dispense with it, for
any other hazard he believed there was none. Notwithstanding
this, I persisted in my refusal.</p>
