<p>This day, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
with the Bishops of Ely, Chichester, St. Asaph,
Bristol, Peterborough, and Bath and Wells, were sent from
the Privy Council prisoners to the Tower, for refusing to
give bail for their appearance, on their not reading the
Declaration for liberty of conscience; they refused to give
bail, as it would have prejudiced their peerage. The concern
of the people for them was wonderful, infinite crowds
on their knees begging their blessing, and praying for
them, as they passed out of the barge along the Tower
wharf.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>
