<p>Was a meeting of the feoffees of the
poor of our parish. This year I would stand one of the
collectors of their rents, to give example to others. My
son was added to the feoffees.</p>

<p>This afternoon came to visit me Sir Edward Deering,
of Surrendon, in Kent, one of the Lords of the Treasury,
with his daughter, married to my worthy friend, Sir Robert
Southwell, Clerk of the Council, now Extraordinary-Envoy
to the Duke of Brandenburgh, and other Princes
in Germany, as before he had been in Portugal, being a
sober, wise, and virtuous gentleman.</p>
