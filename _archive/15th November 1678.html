<p>The Queen's birthday. I never
saw the Court more brave, nor the nation in more apprehension
and consternation. Coleman and one Staly had
now been tried, condemned, and executed. On this,
Oates grew so presumptuous as to accuse the Queen of
intending to poison the King; which certainly that pious
and virtuous lady abhorred the thoughts of, and Oates's
circumstances made it utterly unlikely in my opinion.
He probably thought to gratify some who would have
been glad his Majesty should have married a fruitful
lady; but the King was too kind a husband to let any of
these make impression on him. However, divers of the
Popish peers were sent to the Tower, accused by Oates;
and all the Roman Catholic lords were by a new Act
forever excluded the Parliament; which was a mighty
blow. The King's, Queen's, and Duke's servants, were
banished, and a test to be taken by everybody who pretended
to enjoy any office of public trust, and who would
not be suspected of Popery. I went with Sir William
Godolphin, a member of the Commons' House, to the
Bishop of Ely (Dr. Peter Gunning), to be resolved
whether masses were idolatry, as the text expressed it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
which was so worded, that several good Protestants
scrupled, and Sir William, though a learned man and
excellent divine himself, had some doubts about it. The
Bishop's opinion was that he might take it, though he
wished it had been otherwise worded in the text.</p>

<p>15th January, 1678-79. I went with my Lady Sunderland
to Chelsa, and dined with the Countess of Bristol
[her mother] in the great house, formerly the Duke of
Buckingham's, a spacious and excellent place for the extent
of ground and situation in a good air. The house
is large but ill-contrived, though my Lord of Bristol,
who purchased it after he sold Wimbledon to my Lord
Treasurer, expended much money on it. There were
divers pictures of Titian and Vandyke, and some of
Bassano, very excellent, especially an Adonis and
Venus, a Duke of Venice, a butcher in his shambles
selling meat to a Swiss; and of Vandyke, my Lord of
Bristol's picture, with the Earl of Bedford's at length, in
the same table. There was in the garden a rare collection
of orange trees, of which she was pleased to bestow
some upon me.</p>
