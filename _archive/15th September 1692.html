<p>There happened an earthquake,
which, though not so great as to do any harm in England,
was universal in all these parts of Europe. It
shook the house at Wotton, but was not perceived by any
save a servant or two, who were making my bed, and another
in a garret. I and the rest being at dinner below
in the parlor, were not sensible of it. The dreadful one
in Jamaica this summer was profanely and ludicrously
represented in a puppet play, or some such lewd pastime,
in the fair of Southwark, which caused the Queen to put
down that idle and vicious mock show.</p>
