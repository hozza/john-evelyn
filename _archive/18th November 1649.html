<p>I went with my father-in-law to
see his audience at the French Court, where next the
Pope's Nuncio, he was introduced by the master of ceremonies,
and, after delivery of his credentials, as from our
King, since his <a id="tn_png_282"></a><!--TN: "father s" changed to "father's"-->father's murder, he was most graciously
received by the King of France and his mother, with
whom he had a long audience. This was in the Palais
Cardinal.</p>

<p>After this, being presented to his Majesty and the
Queen Regent I went to see the house built by the late
great Cardinal de Richelieu. The most observable thing
is the gallery, painted with the portraits of the most
illustrious persons and single actions in France, with innumerable
emblems between every table. In the middle
of the gallery, is a neat chapel, rarely paved in work
and devices of several sorts of marble, besides the altar-piece
and two statues of white marble, one of St. John,
the other of the Virgin Mary, by Bernini. The rest of
the apartments are rarely gilded and carved, with some
good modern paintings. In the presence hang three
huge branches of crystal. In the French King's bedchamber,
is an alcove like another chamber, set as it
were in a chamber like a movable box, with a rich
embroidered bed. The fabric of the palace is not magnificent,
being but of two stories; but the garden is so
spacious as to contain a noble basin and fountain continually
playing, and there is a mall, with an elbow, or
turning, to protract it. So I left his Majesty on the
terrace, busy in seeing a bull-baiting, and returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
home in Prince Edward's coach with Mr.Â Paul, the Prince
Elector's agent.</p>
