not only what mischief the Dutch had done; but how triumphantly
their whole fleet lay within the very mouth of
the Thames, all from the North <a id="tn_png_043"></a><!--TN: "Fore-land" changed to "Foreland on Page 34"-->Foreland, Margate, even
to the buoy of the Nore—a dreadful spectacle as ever
Englishmen saw, and a dishonor never to be wiped off!

<p>Here in the river off Chatham, just before the town, lay
the carcase of the "London" (now the third time burnt),
the "Royal Oak," the "James," etc., yet smoking; and now,
when the mischief was done, we were making trifling
forts on the brink of the river. Here were yet forces,
both of horse and foot, with General Middleton continually
expecting the motions of the enemy's fleet. I had much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
discourse with him, who was an experienced commander,
I told him I wondered the King did not fortify Sheerness<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12_12">12</a>
and the Ferry; both abandoned.</p>
