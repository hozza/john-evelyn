<p>Easter day. Myself and son received
the blessed Communion, it being his first time,
and with that whole week's more extraordinary preparation.
I beseech God to make him a sincere and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
good Christian, while I endeavor to instill into him the
fear and love of God, and discharge the duty of a
father.</p>

<p>At the sermon <i>coram Rege</i>, preached by Dr. Sparrow,
Bishop of Exeter, to a most crowded auditory; I stayed
to see whether, according to custom, the Duke of York
received the Communion with the King; but he did not,
to the amazement of everybody. This being the second
year he had forborne, and put it off, and within a day
of the Parliament sitting, who had lately made so severe
an Act against the increase of Popery, gave exceeding
grief and scandal to the whole nation, that the heir of
it, and the son of a martyr for the Protestant religion,
should apostatize. What the consequence of this will be,
God only knows, and wise men dread.</p>
