<p>This evening we arrived at Worcester,
the Judges of Assize and Sheriff just entering as we did.
Viewing the town the next day, we found the Cathedral
much ruined by the late wars, otherwise a noble structure.
The town is neatly paved and very clean, the goodly
river Severn running by it, and standing in a most fertile
country.</p>
