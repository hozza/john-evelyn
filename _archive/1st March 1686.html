<p>Came Sir Gilbert Gerrard to treat
with me about his son's marrying my daughter, Susanna.
The father being obnoxious, and in some suspicion and
displeasure of the King, I would receive no proposal till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
his Majesty had given me leave; which he was pleased
to do; but, after several meetings we broke off, on his
not being willing to secure anything competent for my
daughter's children; besides that I found most of his estate
was in the coal-pits as far off as Newcastle, and on leases
from the Bishop of Durham, who had power to make
concurrent leases, with other difficulties.</p>
