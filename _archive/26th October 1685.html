<p>We returned to London, having
been treated with all sorts of cheer and noble freedom
by that most religious and virtuous lady. She was now
preparing to go for Ireland with her husband, made
Lord Deputy, and went to this country house and ancient
seat of her father and family, to set things in order
during her absence; but never were good people and
neighbors more concerned than all the country (the poor
especially) for the departure of this charitable woman;
everyone was in tears, and she as unwilling to part
from them. There was among them a maiden of primitive
life, the daughter of a poor laboring man, who
had sustained her parents (some time since dead) by
her labor, and has for many years refused marriage, or
to receive any assistance from the parish, besides the
little hermitage my lady gives her rent-free; she lives on
four pence a day, which she gets by spinning; says she
abounds and can give alms to others, living in great
humility and content, without any apparent affectation,
or singularity; she is continually working, praying, or
reading, gives a good account of her knowledge in religion,
visits the sick; is not in the least given to talk; very
modest, of a simple not unseemingly behavior; of a
comely countenance, clad very plain, but clean and tight.
In sum, she appears a saint of an extraordinary sort, in
so religious a life, as is seldom met with in villages now-a-days.</p>
