<p>This day was celebrated the thanksgiving
for the late great victory,<a id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_97_97">97</a> with the utmost pomp
and splendor by the Queen, Court, great Officers, Lords
Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc. The streets were scaffolded
from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned. Every
company was ranged under its banners, the city militia
without the rails, which were all hung with cloth suitable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
to the color of the banner. The Lord Mayor, Sheriffs,
and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards;
the Queen in a rich coach with eight horses,
none with her but the Duchess of Marlborough in a very
plain garment, the Queen full of jewels. Music and
trumpets at every city company. The great officers of
the Crown, Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six
horses, besides innumerable servants, went to St. Paul's,
where the Dean preached. After this, the Queen went
back in the same order to St. James's. The city companies
feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night. Music for the church and anthems composed by
the best masters. The day before was wet and stormy,
but this was one of the most serene and calm days that
had been all the year.</p>

<p>October, 1704. The year has been very plentiful.</p>
