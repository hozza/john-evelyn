<p>Went to see Mr.Â Povey's elegant house
in Lincoln's-Inn Fields, where the perspective in his court,
painted by Streeter, is indeed excellent, with the vases
in imitation of porphyry, and fountains; the inlaying of
his closet; above all, his pretty cellar and ranging of
his wine bottles.</p>
