<p>Fast day. Visited the Bishop of St.
Asaph; his conversation was on the Vaudois in Savoy,
who had been thought so near destruction and final<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
extirpation by the French, being totally given up to
slaughter, so that there were no hopes for them; but now
it pleased God that the Duke of Savoy, who had hitherto
joined with the French in their persecution, being now
pressed by them to deliver up Saluzzo and Turin as
cautionary towns, on suspicion that he might at last
come into the Confederacy of the German Princes, did
secretly concert measures with, and afterward declared
for, them. He then invited these poor people from their
dispersion among the mountains whither they had fled,
and restored them to their country, their dwellings, and
the exercise of their religion, and begged pardon for the
ill usage they had received, charging it on the cruelty
of the French who forced him to it. These being the
remainder of those persecuted Christians which the Bishop
of St. Asaph had so long affirmed to be the two witnesses
spoken of in the Revelation, who should be killed and
brought to life again, it was looked on as an extraordinary
thing that this prophesying Bishop should persuade
two fugitive ministers of the Vaudois to return to their
country, and furnish them with Â£20 toward their journey,
at that very time when nothing but universal destruction
was to be expected, assuring them and showing them
from the Apocalypse, that their countrymen should be
returned safely to their country before they arrived.
This happening contrary to all expectation and appearance,
did exceedingly credit the Bishop's confidence how
that prophecy of the witnesses should come to pass, just
at the time, and the very month, he had spoken of some
years before.</p>

<p>I afterward went with him to Mr. Boyle and Lady
Ranelagh his sister, to whom he explained the necessity
of it so fully, and so learnedly made out, with what
events were immediately to follow, viz, the French King's
ruin, the calling of the Jews to be near at hand, but
that the Kingdom of Antichrist would not yet be utterly
destroyed till thirty years, when Christ should begin the
Millenium, not as personally and visibly reigning on
earth, but that the true religion and universal peace
should obtain through all the world. He showed how
Mr. Brightman, Mr. Mede, and other interpreters of these
events failed, by mistaking and reckoning the year as
the Latins and others did, to consist of the present cal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>culation,
so many days to the year, whereas the Apocalypse
reckons after the Persian account, as Daniel did,
whose visions St. John all along explains as meaning
only the Christian Church.</p>
