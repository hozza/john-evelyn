<p>Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord
Privy Seal, a very worthy gentleman. He showed me
divers rare pictures of very many of the old and best
masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the
best drawings of the old masters. Sir John Fenwick,
one of the conspirators, was taken. Great subscriptions
in Scotland to their East India Company. Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for
daily provisions in the markets. Guineas lowered to
twenty-two shillings, and great sums daily transported
to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined
of the new and now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity
that tumults are every day feared, nobody paying or receiving
money; so imprudent was the late Parliament to
condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies. To this add the fraud of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
bankers and goldsmiths, who having gotten immense
riches by extortion, keep up their treasure in expectation
of enhancing its value. Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late
Duke of Buckingham's estate at nearly £90,000, and reputed
to have nearly as much in cash. Banks and lotteries
every day set up.</p>
