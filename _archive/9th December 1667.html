<p>To visit the late Lord Chancellor.<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13_13">13</a>
I found him in his garden at his new-built palace, sitting
in his gout wheel-chair, and seeing the gates setting up
toward the north and the fields. He looked and spake
very disconsolately. After some while deploring his condition
to me, I took my leave. Next morning, I heard he
was gone; though I am persuaded that, had he gone
sooner, though but to Cornbury, and there lain quiet, it
would have satisfied the Parliament. That which exasperated
them was his presuming to stay and contest the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
accusation as long as it was possible: and they were on
the point of sending him to the Tower.</p>
