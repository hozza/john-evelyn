<p>I supped in the city with my Lady
Catherine Scott, at one Mr.Â Dubois, where was a gentlewoman
called Everard, who was a very great chemist.</p>

<p>Sunday 7th July, 1650. In the afternoon, having a mind
to see what was doing among the Rebels, then in full
possession at Whitehall, I went thither, and found one at
exercise in the chapel, after their way; thence, to St.
James's, where another was preaching in the court abroad.</p>
