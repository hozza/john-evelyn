<p>My son and I dining at my
Lord Chamberlain's, he showed us among others that incomparable
piece of Raphael's, being a Minister of State
dictating to Guicciardini, the earnestness of whose face
looking up in expectation of what he was next to write,
is so to the life, and so natural, as I esteem it one of
the choicest pieces of that admirable artist. There was
a woman's head of Leonardo da Vinci; a Madonna of old
Palma, and two of Vandyke's, of which one was his own
picture at length, when young, in a leaning posture; the
other, an eunuch, singing. Rare pieces indeed!</p>
