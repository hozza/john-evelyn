<p>The writings for the settling
jointure and other contracts of marriage of my son were
finished and sealed. The lady was to bring £5,000, in consideration
of a settlement of £500 a year present maintenance,
which was likewise to be her jointure, and £500
a year after mine and my wife's decease. But, with God's
blessing, it will be at the least £1,000 a year more in a
few years. I pray God make him worthy of it, and a
comfort to his excellent mother, who deserves much from
him!</p>
