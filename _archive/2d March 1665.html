<p>I went with his Majesty into the
lobby behind the House of Lords, where I saw the King
and the rest of the Lords robe themselves, and got into
the House of Lords in a corner near the woolsack, on which
the Lord Chancellor sits next below the throne: the King
sat in all the regalia, the crown-imperial on his head, the
sceptre and globe, etc. The Duke of Albemarle bore the
sword, the Duke of Ormond, the cap of dignity. The rest
of the Lords robed in their places:—a most splendid and
august convention. Then came the Speaker and the
House of Commons, and at the bar made a speech, and
afterward presented several bills, a nod only passing
them, the clerk saying, <i>Le Roy le veult</i>, as to public bills,
as to private, <i>Soit faite commeil est desirè</i>. Then, his Majesty
made a handsome but short speech, commanding my Lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Privy Seal to prorogue the Parliament, which he did, the
Chancellor being ill and absent. I had not before seen
this ceremony.</p>
