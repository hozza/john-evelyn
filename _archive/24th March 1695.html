<p><span class="smcap">Easter Day.</span> Mr. Duncomb, parson
of this parish, preached, which he hardly comes to
above once a year though but seven or eight miles
off; a florid discourse, read out of his notes. The
Holy Sacrament followed, which he administered with
very little reverence, leaving out many prayers and
exhortations; nor was there any oblation. This ought
to be reformed, but my good brother did not well consider
when he gave away this living and the next [Abinger].</p>

<p>March, 1695. The latter end of the month sharp and
severely cold, with much snow and hard frost; no appearance
of spring.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>
