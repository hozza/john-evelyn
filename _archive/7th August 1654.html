<p>Went to Uppingham, the shire town
of Rutland, pretty and well built of stone, which is a
rarity in that part of England, where most of the rural
parishes are but of mud; and the people living as wretchedly
as in the most impoverished parts of France, which
they much resemble, being idle and sluttish. The country
(especially Leicestershire) much in common; the
gentry free drinkers.</p>
