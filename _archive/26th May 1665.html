<p>To treat with the Holland Ambassador
at Chelsea, for release of divers prisoners of war in Holland
on exchange here. After dinner, being called into
the Council-Chamber at Whitehall, I gave his Majesty an
account of what I had done, informing him of the vast
charge upon us, now amounting to no less than Â£1,000
weekly.</p>
