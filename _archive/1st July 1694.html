<p>Mr. Duncomb, minister of Albury,
preached at Wotton, a very religious and exact discourse.</p>

<p>The first great bank for a fund of money being now
established by Act of Parliament, was filled and completed
to the sum of Â£120,000, and put under the
government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.
All who adventured any sum had four per cent.,
so long as it lay in the bank, and had power either to
take it out at pleasure, or transfer it. Glorious steady
weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty generally.</p>
