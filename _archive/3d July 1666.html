<p>I went to sit with the Commissioners at
the Tower, where our commission being read, we made
some progress in business, our Secretary being Sir George
Wharton, that famous mathematician who wrote the yearly
Almanac during his Majesty's troubles. Thence, to
Painters' Hall, to our other commission, and dined at my
Lord Mayor's.</p>
