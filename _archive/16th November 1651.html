<p>Visited Dean Stewart, who had
been sick about two days; when, going up to his lodging,
I found him dead; which affected me much, as besides
his particular affection and love to me, he was of
incomparable parts and great learning, of exemplary life,
and a very great loss to the whole church. He was
buried the next day with all our church's ceremonies,
many noble persons accompanying the corpse.</p>
