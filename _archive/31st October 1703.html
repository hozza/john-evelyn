<p>This day, being eighty-three years
of age, upon examining what concerned me, more particularly
the past year, with the great mercies of God
preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble
thanks, beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of
my sins past, and to prepare me for a better life by the
virtue of his grace and mercy, for the sake of my blessed
Savior.</p>
