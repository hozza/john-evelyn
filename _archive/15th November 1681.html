<p>I dined with the Earl of Essex
who, after dinner in his study, where we were alone,
related to me how much he had been scandalized and
injured in the report of his being privy to the marriage
of his Lady's niece, the rich young widow of the late
Lord Ogle, sole daughter of the Earl of Northumberland;
showing me a letter of Mr. Thynn's, excusing himself for
not communicating his marriage to his Lordship. He
acquainted me also with the whole story of that unfortunate
lady being betrayed by her grandmother, the
Countess of Northumberland, and Colonel Bret, for money;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and that though, upon the importunity of the Duke of
Monmouth, he had delivered to the grandmother a particular
of the jointure which Mr. Thynn pretended he
would settle on the lady, yet he totally discouraged the
proceeding as by no means a competent match for one
that both by birth and fortune might have pretended
to the greatest prince in Christendom; that he also proposed
the Earl of Kingston, or the Lord Cranburn, but
was by no means for Mr. Thynn.</p>
