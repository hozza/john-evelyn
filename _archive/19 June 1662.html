<p>I went to Albury, to visit Mr. Henry
Howard, soon after he had procured the Dukedom to be
restored. This gentleman had now compounded a debt
of £200,000, contracted by his grandfather. I was much
obliged to that great virtuoso, and to this young gentleman,
with whom I stayed a fortnight.</p>
