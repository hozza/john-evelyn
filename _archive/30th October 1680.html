<p>I went to London to be private,
my birthday being the next day, and I now arrived at
my sixtieth year; on which I began a more solemn survey
of my whole life, in order to the making and confirming
my peace with God, by an accurate scrutiny of
all my actions past, as far as I was able to call them to
mind. How difficult and uncertain, yet how necessary a
work! The Lord be merciful to me, and accept me!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Who can tell how oft he offendeth? Teach me, therefore,
so to number my days, that I may apply my heart
unto wisdom, and make my calling and election sure.
Amen, Lord Jesus!</p>
