<p>Nothing yet of action from abroad.
Muttering of a design to bring forces under color of an
expected descent, to be a standing army for other purposes.
Talk of a declaration of the French King, offering
mighty advantages to the confederates, exclusive of King
William; and another of King James, with an universal
pardon, and referring the composing of all differences to
a Parliament. These were yet but discourses; but something
is certainly under it. A declaration or manifesto
from King James, so written, that many thought it reasonable,
and much more to the purpose than any of his
former.</p>

chapel; the common church office was used for the King
without naming the person, with some other, apposite to
the necessity and circumstances of the time.</p>
