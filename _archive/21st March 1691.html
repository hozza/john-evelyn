<p>Dined at Sir William Fermor's,
who showed me many good pictures. After dinner, a
French servant played rarely on the lute. Sir William
had now bought all the remaining statues collected
with so much expense by the famous Thomas, Earl of
Arundel, and sent them to his seat at Easton, near Towcester.<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_75_75">75</a></p>
