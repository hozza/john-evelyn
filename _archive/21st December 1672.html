<div class="sidenote">LONDON</div>

<p>1st January, 1672-73. After public prayers in the chapel
at Whitehall, when I gave God solemn thanks for all his
mercies to me the year past, and my humble supplications
to him for his blessing the year now entering, I
returned home, having my poor deceased servant (Adams)
to bury, who died of pleurisy.</p>
