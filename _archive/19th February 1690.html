<p>I dined with the Marquis of
Carmarthen (late Lord Danby), where was Lieutenant-General
Douglas, a very considerate and sober commander,
going for Ireland. He related to us the exceeding
neglect of the English soldiers, suffering severely for
want of clothes and necessaries this winter, exceedingly
magnifying their courage and bravery during all their
hardships. There dined also Lord Lucas, Lieutenant of
the Tower, and the Bishop of <a id="tn_png_313"></a><!--TN: Period added after "St" on Page 300-->St. Asaph. The Privy
Seal was again put in commission, Mr. Cheny (who
married my kinswoman, Mrs. Pierrepoint), Sir Thomas
Knatchbull, and Sir P. W. Pultney. The imprudence of
both sexes was now become so great and universal, persons
of all ranks keeping their courtesans publicly, that
the King had lately directed a letter to the Bishops to
order their clergy to preach against that sin, swearing,
etc., and to put the ecclesiastical laws in execution without
any indulgence.</p>

<p>25th <a id="tn_png_313a"></a><!--TN: Comma added after "February"-->February, 1690. I went to Kensington, which
King William had bought of Lord Nottingham, and altered,
but was yet a patched building, but with the garden,
however, it is a very sweet villa, having to it the
park and a straight new way through this park.</p>
