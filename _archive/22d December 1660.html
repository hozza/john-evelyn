<p>The marriage of the Chancellor's
daughter being now newly owned, I went to see her,
she being Sir Richard Browne's intimate acquaintance
when she waited on the Princess of Orange; she was now
at her father's, at Worcester House, in the Strand. We
all kissed her hand, as did also my Lord Chamberlain
(Manchester) and Countess of Northumberland. This was
a strange change—can it succeed well?—I spent the
evening at St. James's, whither the Princess Henrietta was
retired during the fatal sickness of her sister, the Princess
of Orange, now come over to salute the King her brother.
The Princess gave my wife an extraordinary compliment
and gracious acceptance, for the "Character"<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_64_64">64</a> she had
presented her the day before, and which was afterward
printed.</p>
