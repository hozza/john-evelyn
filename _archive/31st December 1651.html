<p>Preached Dr. Wolley, after which
was celebrated the Holy Communion, which I received
also, preparative of my journey, being now resolved to
leave France altogether, and to return God Almighty
thanks for His gracious protection of me this past
year.</p>

<p>2d January, 1651-52. News of my sister Glanville's
death in childbed, which exceedingly affected me.</p>

<p>I went to one Mark Antonio, an incomparable artist in
enameling. He wrought by the lamp figures in boss, of
a large size, even to the life, so that nothing could be
better molded. He told us stories of a Genoese jeweler,
who had the great <span style="font-size:.8em;">ARCANUM</span>, and had made projection
before him several times. He met him at Cyprus traveling
into Egypt; in his return from whence, he died at
sea, and the secret with him, that else he had promised
to have left it to him; that all his effects were seized on,
and dissipated by the Greeks in the vessel, to an immense
value. He also affirmed, that being in a goldsmith's shop
at Amsterdam, a person of very low stature came in, and
desired the goldsmith to melt him a pound of lead; which
done, he unscrewed the pommel of his sword, and taking
out of a little box a small quantity of powder, casting it
into the crucible, poured an ingot out, which when cold
he took up, saying, "Sir, you will be paid for your lead
in the crucible," and so went out immediately. When he
was gone the goldsmith found four ounces of good gold in
it; but could never set eye again on the little man, though
he sought all the city for him. Antonio asserted this
with great obtestation; nor know I what to think of it,
there are so many impostors and people who love to tell
strange stories, as this artist did, who had been a great
rover, and spoke ten different languages.</p>
