<p>I went to obtain of my Lord Devonshire
that my nephew, George, might be brought up
with my young Lord, his son, to whom I was recommending
Mr. Wase. I also inspected the manner of
camleting silk and grograms at one Monsieur La Dorées
in Moor-fields, and thence to Colonel Morley, one of their
Council of State, as then called, who had been my schoolfellow,
to request a pass for my wife's safe landing, and
the goods she was to bring with her out of France; which
he courteously granted, and did me many other kindnesses,
that was a great matter in those days.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, at Charlton church, where I heard a
Rabinical sermon. Here is a fair monument in black
marble of Sir Adam Newton, who built that fair house
near it for Prince Henry, and where my noble friend,
Sir Henry Newton, succeeded him.</p>
