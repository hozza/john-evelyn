<p>We took mules, passing the first
night very late in sight of St. Baume, and the solitary
grot where they affirmed Mary Magdalen did her penance.
The next day, we lay at Perigueux, a city built
on an old foundation; witness the ruins of a most stately
amphitheatre, which I went out to design, being about a
flight-shot from the town; they call it now the Rolsies.
There is also a strong tower near the town, called
the Visone, but the town and city are at some distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
from each other. It is a bishopric; has a cathedral
with divers noblemen's houses in sight of the sea. The
place was formerly called Forum Julij, well known by
antiquaries.</p>
