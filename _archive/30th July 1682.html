<p>Went to visit our good neighbor, Mr.
Bohun, whose whole house is a cabinet of all elegancies,
especially Indian; in the hall are contrivances of Japan
screens, instead of wainscot; and there is an excellent
pendule clock inclosed in the curious flowerwork of Mr.
Gibbons, in the middle of the vestibule. The landscapes
of the screens represent the manner of living, and country
of the Chinese. But, above all, his lady's cabinet is
adorned on the fret, ceiling, and chimney-piece, with
Mr. Gibbons's best carving. There are also some of
Streeter's best paintings, and many rich curiosities of
gold and silver as growing in the mines. The gardens
are exactly kept, and the whole place very agreeable and
well watered. The owners are good neighbors, and Mr.
Bohun has also built and endowed a hospital for eight
poor people, with a pretty chapel, and every necessary
accommodation.</p>
