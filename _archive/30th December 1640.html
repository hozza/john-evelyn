<p>I saw his Majesty (coming from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
his Northern Expedition) ride in pomp and a kind of
ovation, with all the marks of a happy peace, restored to
the affections of his people, being conducted through
London with a most splendid cavalcade; and on the 3d
of November following (a day never to be mentioned
without a curse), to that long ungrateful, foolish, and
fatal Parliament, the beginning of all our sorrows for
twenty years after, and the period of the most happy
monarch in the world: <i>Quis talia fando!</i></p>

<p>But my father being by this time entered into a
dropsy, an indisposition the most unsuspected, being a
person so exemplarily temperate, and of admirable
regimen, hastened me back to Wotton, December the
12th; where, the 24th following, between twelve and one
o'clock at noon, departed this life that excellent man
and indulgent parent, retaining his senses and piety
to the last, which he most tenderly expressed in
blessing us, whom he now left to the world and the
worst of times, while he was taken from the evil to
come.</p>

<p>1641. It was a sad and lugubrious beginning of the
year, when on the 2d of January, 1640-1, we at night
followed the mourning hearse to the church at Wotton;
when, after a sermon and funeral oration by the minister,
my father was interred near his formerly erected monument,
and mingled with the ashes of our mother, his
dear wife. Thus we were bereft of both our parents in
a period when we most of all stood in need of their
counsel and assistance, especially myself, of a raw, vain,
uncertain, and very unwary inclination: but so it pleased
God to make trial of my conduct in a conjuncture of
the greatest and most prodigious hazard that ever the
youth of England saw; and, if I did not amidst all this
impeach my liberty nor my virtue with the rest who
made shipwreck of both, it was more the infinite goodness
and mercy of God than the least providence or
discretion of mine own, who now thought of nothing
but the pursuit of vanity, and the confused imaginations
of young men.</p>
