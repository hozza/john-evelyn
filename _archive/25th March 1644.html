<p>We arrived at Caen, a noble and
beautiful town, situate on the river Orne, which passes
quite through it, the two sides of the town joined only
by a bridge of one entire arch. We lay at the Angel,
where we were very well used, the place being abundantly
furnished with provisions, at a cheap rate. The most considerable
object is the great Abbey and Church, large
and rich, built after the Gothic manner, having two spires
and middle lantern at the west end, all of stone. The
choir round and large, in the center whereof elevated
on a square, handsome, but plain sepulcher, is this
inscription:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Hoc sepulchrum invictissimi juxta et clementissimi conquestoris,
Gulielmi, dum viverat Anglorum Regis, Normannorum Cenomannorumque
Principis, hujus insignis Abbatiae piissimi Fundatoris: <a id="tn_png_087"></a><!--TN: "Cum-anno" changed to "Cum anno"-->Cum anno
1562 vesano hæreticorum furore direptum fuisset, pio tandem
nobilium ejusdem Abbatiae religiosorum gratitudinis sensu in tam beneficum
largitorem, instauratum fuit, aº D'ni 1642. D'no Johanne de
Bailhache Assætorii proto priore. D.D."</p>

<p>On the other side are these monkish rhymes:</p>

</p><p>We went to the castle, which is strong and fair, and
so is the town-house, built on the bridge which unites
the two towns. Here are schools and an University for
the Jurists.</p>

<p>The whole town is handsomely built of that excellent
stone so well known by that name in England. I was
led to a pretty garden, planted with hedges of alaternus,
having at the entrance a screen at an exceeding height,
accurately cut in topiary work, with well understood
architecture, consisting of pillars, niches, friezes, and other
ornaments, with great curiosity; some of the columns
curiously wreathed, others spiral, all according to art.</p>
