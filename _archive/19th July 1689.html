<p>The Marshal de Schomberg went now
as General toward Ireland, to the relief of Londonderry.
Our fleet lay before Brest. The Confederates passing the
Rhine, besiege Bonn and Mayence, to obtain a passage
into France. A great victory gotten by the Muscovites,
taking and burning Perecop. A new rebel against the
Turks threatens the destruction of that tyranny. All
Europe in arms against France, and hardly to be found
in history so universal a face of war.</p>

<p>The Convention (or Parliament as some called it) sitting,
exempt the Duke of Hanover from the succession
to the crown, which they seem to confine to the present
new King, his wife, and Princess Anne of Denmark, who
is so monstrously swollen, that it is doubted whether her
being thought with child may prove a <span class="small">TYMPANY</span> only, so
that the unhappy family of the Stuarts seems to be extinguishing;
and then what government is likely to be
next set up is unknown, whether regal and by election,
or otherwise, the Republicans and Dissenters
from the Church of England evidently looking that
way.</p>

<p>The Scots have now again voted down Episcopacy
there. Great discontents through this nation at the slow
proceedings of the King, and the incompetent instruments
and officers he advances to the greatest and most necessary
charges.</p>
