<p>Dr. Pearson, Bishop of Chester,
preached on Hebrews ix. 14; a most incomparable sermon
from one of the most learned divines of our nation.
I dined at my Lord Arlington's with the Duke and
Duchess of Monmouth; she is one of the wisest and
craftiest of her sex, and has much wit. Here was also
the learned Isaac Vossius.</p>

<p>During Lent there is constantly the most excellent
preaching by the most eminent bishops and divines of
the nation.</p>
