<p>Receiving a letter from Mr. Philip
Howard, Lord Almoner to the Queen, that Monsieur
Evelin, first physician to Madame (who was now come to
Dover to visit the King her brother), was come to town,
greatly desirous to see me; but his stay so short, that he
could not come to me, I went with my brother to meet
him at the Tower, where he was seeing the magazines
and other curiosities, having never before been in England:
we renewed our alliance and friendship, with much
regret on both sides that, he being to return toward
Dover that evening, we could not enjoy one another
any longer. How this French family, Ivelin, of Evelin,
Normandy, a very ancient and noble house is grafted
into our pedigree, see in the collection brought from
Paris, 1650.</p>
