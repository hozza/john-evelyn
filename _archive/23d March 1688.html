<p>Dr. Parker, Bishop of Oxford, who
so lately published his extravagant treatise about transubstantiation,
and for abrogating the test and penal
laws, died. He was esteemed a violent, passionate,
haughty man, but yet being pressed to declare for the
Church of Rome, he utterly refused it. A remarkable
end!</p>

<p>The French <span class="smcap">Tyrant</span> now finding he could make no
proselytes among those Protestants of quality, and others,
whom he had caused to be shut up in dungeons, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
confined to nunneries and monasteries, gave them, after
so long trial, a general releasement, and leave to go out
of the kingdom, but utterly taking their estates and their
children; so that great numbers came daily into England
and other places, where they were received and relieved
with very considerate Christian charity. This Providence
and goodness of God to those who thus constantly held
out, did so work upon those miserable poor souls who, to
avoid the persecution, signed their renunciation, and to
save their estates went to mass, that reflecting on what
they had done, they grew so affected in their conscience,
that not being able to support it, they in great numbers
through all the French provinces, acquainted the magistrates
and lieutenants that being sorry for their apostacy,
they were resolved to return to their old religion; that
they would go no more to mass, but peaceably assemble
when they could, to beg pardon and worship God, but so
without weapons as not to give the least umbrage of
rebellion or sedition, imploring their pity and commiseration;
and, accordingly, meeting so from time to time,
the dragoon-missioners, Popish officers and priests, fell
upon them, murdered and put them to death, whoever
they could lay hold on; they without the least resistance
embraced death, torture, or hanging, with singing psalms
and praying for their persecutors to the last breath, yet
still continuing the former assembling of themselves in
desolate places, suffering with incredible constancy, that
through God's mercy they might obtain pardon for this
lapse. Such examples of Christian behavior have not
been seen since the primitive persecutions; and doubtless
God will do some signal work in the end, if we can with
patience and resignation hold out, and depend on his
Providence.</p>
