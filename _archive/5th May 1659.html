<p>I went to visit my brother in London;
and next day, to see a new opera, after the Italian way,
in recitative music and scenes, much inferior to the Italian
composure and magnificence; but it was prodigious
that in a time of such public consternation such a vanity
should be kept up, or permitted. I, being engaged with
company, could not decently resist the going to see it,
though my heart smote me for it.</p>
