<p>We arrived at Brussels at nine in
the morning. The Stadt-house, near the market place,
is, for the carving in freestone, a most laborious and
finished piece, well worthy observation. The flesh-shambles
are also built of stone. I was pleased with certain
small engines, by which a girl, or boy, was able to draw
up, or let down, great bridges, which in divers parts of
this city crossed the channel for the benefit of passengers.
The walls of this town are very entire, and full of
towers at competent distances. The cathedral is built
upon a very high and exceeding steep ascent, to which
we mounted by fair steps of stone. Hence I walked to
a convent of English Nuns, with whom I sat discoursing
most part of the afternoon.</p>
