<p>The Bishop of St. Asaph, Lord
Almoner, preached before the King and Queen, the
whole discourse being an historical narrative of the
Church of England's several deliverances, especially that
of this anniversary, signalized by being also the birthday
of the Prince of Orange, his marriage (which was on the
4th), and his landing at Torbay this day. There was a
splendid ball and other rejoicings.</p>
