<p>The Bank lending the Â£200,000 to
pay the array in Flanders, that had done nothing against
the enemy, had so exhausted the treasure of the nation,
that one could not have borrowed money under 14 or 15
per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per
cent. Reasonable good harvest weather. I went to
Lambeth and dined with the Archbishop, who had been
at Court on the complaint against Dr. Thomas Watson,
Bishop of St. David's, who was suspended for simony.
The Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the
Canon law, and how exceedingly unreasonable all their
pleadings appeared to him.</p>

<p>September, 1696. Fine seasonable weather, and a great
harvest after a cold, wet summer. Scarcity in Scotland.</p>
