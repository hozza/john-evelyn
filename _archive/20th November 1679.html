<p>I dined with Mr. Slingsby,
Master of the Mint, with my wife, invited to hear music,
which was exquisitely performed by four of the most
renowned masters: Du Prue, a Frenchman, on the lute;
Signor Bartholomeo, an Italian, on the harpsichord;
Nicholao on the violin; but, above all, for its sweetness
and novelty, the <i>viol d'amore</i> of five wire strings played
on with a bow, being but an ordinary violin, played on
lyre-way, by a German. There was also a <i>flute douce</i>,
now in much request for accompanying the voice. Mr.
Slingsby, whose son and daughter played skillfully, had
these meetings frequently in his house.</p>
