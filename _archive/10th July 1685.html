<p>The Count of Castel Mellor, that
great favorite and prime minister of Alphonso, late King
of Portugal, after several years' banishment, being now
received to grace and called home by Don Pedro, the
present King, as having been found a person of the
greatest integrity after all his sufferings, desired me to
spend part of this day with him, and assist him in a collection
of books and other curiosities, which he would
carry with him into Portugal.</p>

<p>Mr. Hussey, a young gentleman who made love to my
late dear child, but whom she could not bring herself to
answer in affection, died now of the same cruel disease,
for which I was extremely sorry, because he never enjoyed
himself after my daughter's decease, nor was I
averse to the match, could she have overcome her disinclination.</p>
