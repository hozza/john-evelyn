<p>I was ordered, by letter from the
Council, to repair forthwith to his Majesty, whom I found
in the Pall-Mall, in St. James's Park, where his Majesty
coming to me from the company, commanded me to go
immediately to the seacoast, and to observe the motion of
the Dutch fleet and ours, the Duke and so many of the
flower of our nation being now under sail, coming from
Portsmouth, through the Downs, where it was believed
there might be an encounter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
