<p>Set out for Paris, taking post at
Gravesend, and so that night to Canterbury, where being
surprised by the soldiers, and having only an antiquated
pass, with some fortunate dexterity I got clear of them
though not without extraordinary hazard, having before
counterfeited one with success, it being so difficult to
procure one of the rebels without entering into oaths,
which I never would do. At Dover, money to the
searchers and officers was as authentic as the hand and
seal of Bradshawe himself, where I had not so much as
my trunk opened.</p>
