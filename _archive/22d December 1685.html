<p>Our patent for executing the
office of Privy Seal during the absence of the Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland, being this day sealed by the Lord
Chancellor, we went afterward to St. James, where the
Court then was on occasion of building at Whitehall; his
Majesty delivered the seal to my Lord Tiviot and myself,
the other Commissioners not being come, and then gave
us his hand to kiss. There were the two Venetian Ambassadors
and a world of company; among the rest the
first Popish Nuncio that had been in England since the
Reformation; so wonderfully were things changed, to the
universal jealousy.</p>
