<p>I saw the procession to and from the
Abbey Church of Westminster, with the great feast in
Westminster Hall, at the coronation of King William
and Queen Mary. What was different from former coronations,
was some alteration in the coronation oath.
Dr. Burnet, now made Bishop of Sarum, preached with
great applause. The Parliament men had scaffolds and
places which took up the one whole side of the Hall.
When the King and Queen had dined, the ceremony of
the Champion, and other services by tenure were performed.
The Parliament men were feasted in the Exchequer
chamber, and had each of them a gold medal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
given them, worth five-and-forty shillings. On the one
side were the effigies of the King and Queen inclining
one to the other; on the reverse was Jupiter throwing a
bolt at Ph√§eton the words, "<i>Ne totus absumatur</i>": which
was but dull, seeing they might have had out of the
poet something as apposite. The sculpture was very
mean.</p>

<p>Much of the splendor of the proceeding was abated by
the absence of divers who should have contributed to it,
there being but five Bishops, four Judges (no more being
yet sworn), and several noblemen and great ladies wanting;
the feast, however, was magnificent. The next day
the House of Commons went and kissed their new Majesties'
hands in the Banqueting House.</p>
