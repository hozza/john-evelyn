<p>This night I was invited by Mr.
Roger L'Estrange to hear the incomparable Lubicer on
the violin. His variety on a few notes and plain ground,
with that wonderful dexterity, was admirable. Though a
young man, yet so perfect and skillful, that there was
nothing, however cross and perplexed, brought to him by
our artists, which he did not play off at sight with
ravishing sweetness and improvements, to the astonishment
of our best masters. In sum, he played on the
single instrument a full concert, so as the rest flung down
their instruments, acknowledging the victory. As to
my own particular, I stand to this hour amazed that God
should give so great perfection to so young a person.
There were at that time as excellent in their profession
as any were thought to be in Europe, Paul Wheeler, Mr.
Mell, and others, till this prodigy appeared. I can no
longer question the effects we read of in David's harp to
charm evil spirits, or what is said some particular notes
produced in the passions of Alexander, and that King of
Denmark.</p>
