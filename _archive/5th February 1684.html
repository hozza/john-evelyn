<p>It began to thaw, but froze again.
My coach crossed from Lambeth, to the Horse-ferry at
Milbank, Westminster. The booths were almost all taken
down; but there was first a map or landscape cut in copper
representing all the manner of the camp, and the
several actions, sports, and pastimes thereon, in memory
of so signal a frost.</p>
