<p>I was at the audience of the
Russian Ambassador before both their Majesties in the
Banqueting House. The presents were carried before
him, held up by his followers in two ranks before the
King's State, and consisted of tapestry (one suite of
which was doubtlessly brought from France as being of
that fabric, the Ambassador having passed through that
kingdom as he came out of Spain), a large Persian carpet,
furs of sable and ermine, etc.; but nothing was so
splendid and exotic as the Ambassador who came soon
after the King's restoration. This present Ambassador
was exceedingly offended that his coach was not permitted
to come into the Court, till, being told that no
King's Ambassador did, he was pacified, yet requiring
an attestation of it under the hand of Sir Charles Cotterell,
the Master of the Ceremonies; being, it seems,
afraid he should offend his Master, if he omitted the
least punctilio. It was reported he condemned his son
to lose his head for shaving off his beard, and putting
himself in the French mode at Paris, and that he would
have executed it, had not the French King intercededâ€”but
qy. of this.</p>
