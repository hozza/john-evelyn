<p>The Bishop of Gloucester
preached at the Abbey at the funeral of the Bishop of
Hereford, brother to the Duke of Albemarle. It was a
decent solemnity. There was a silver miter, with episcopal
robes, borne by the herald before the hearse, which
was followed by the Duke his brother, and all the bishops,
with divers noblemen.</p>
