<p>Was the solemn and greatest
ceremony of all the State Ecclesiastical, viz, the procession
of the Pope (Innocent X.) to St. John di Laterano,
which, standing on the steps of Ara Celi, near the Capitol,
I saw pass in this manner:—First went a guard of
Switzers to make way, and divers of the avant guard of
horse carrying lances. Next followed those who carried
the robes of the Cardinals, two and two; then the Cardinal's
mace bearers; the caudatari, on mules; the masters
of their horse; the Pope's barber, tailor, baker, gardener,
and other domestic officers, all on horseback, in rich liveries;
the squires belonging to the Guard; five men in
rich liveries led five noble Neapolitan horses, white as
snow, covered to the ground with trappings richly embroidered;
which is a service paid by the King of Spain for
the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, pretended feudatories
to the Pope; three mules of exquisite beauty and price,
trapped in crimson velvet; next followed three rich litters
with mules, the litters empty; the master of the
horse alone, with his squires; five trumpeters; the <i>armerieri
estra muros</i>; the fiscal and consistorial advocates; <i>capellani</i>,
<i>camerieri de honore</i>, <i>cubiculari</i> and chamberlains,
called <i>secreti</i>.</p>

<p>Then followed four other <i>camerieri</i> with four caps of
the dignity-pontifical, which were Cardinals' hats carried
on staves; four trumpets; after them a number of noble
Romans and gentlemen of quality, very rich, and followed
by innumerable <i>staffiéri</i> and pages; the secretaries of the
<i>chancellaria</i>, <i>abbreviatori-accoliti</i> in their long robes, and
on mules; <i>auditori di rota</i>; the dean of the <i>rôti</i> and master
of the sacred palace, on mules, with grave but rich
footclothes, and in flat episcopal hats; then went more
of the Roman and other nobility and courtiers, with
divers pages in most rich liveries on horseback; fourteen
drums belonging to the Capitol; the marshals with their
staves; the two syndics; the conservators of the city, in
robes of crimson damask; the knight-gonfalonier and
prior of the R. R., in velvet toques; six of his Holiness's
mace bearers; then the captain, or governor, of the Castle
of St. Angelo, upon a brave prancer; the governor of
the city; on both sides of these two long ranks of Switzers,
the masters of the ceremonies; the cross bearer on
horseback, with two priests at each hand on foot; pages,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
footmen, and guards, in abundance. Then came the
Pope himself, carried in a litter, or rather open chair, of
crimson velvet, richly embroidered, and borne by two
stately mules; as he went he held up two fingers, blessing
the multitude who were on their knees, or looking
out of their windows and houses, with loud <i>vivas</i> and
acclamations of felicity to their new Prince. This chair
was followed by the master of his chamber, cup bearer,
secretary, and physician; then came the Cardinal-Bishops,
Cardinal-Priests, Cardinal-Deacons, Patriarchs, Archbishops,
and Bishops, all in their several and distinct
habits, some in red, others in green flat hats with tassels,
all on gallant mules richly trapped with velvet, and led
by their servants in great state and multitudes; after
them, the apostolical protonotary, auditor, treasurer, and
referendaries; lastly, the trumpets of the rear guard, two
pages of arms in helmets with feathers, and carrying
lances; two captains; the pontifical standard of the Church;
the two <i>alfieri</i>, or cornets, of the Pope's light horse, who
all followed in armor and carrying lances; which, with
innumerable rich coaches, litters, and people, made up
the procession. What they did at St. John di Laterano,
I could not see, by reason of the prodigious crowd; so I
spent most of the day in viewing the two triumphal
arches which had been purposely erected a few days before,
and till now covered; the one by the Duke of Parma,
in the Foro Romano, the other by the Jews in the Capitol,
with flattering inscriptions. They were of excellent
architecture, decorated with statues and abundance of
ornaments proper for the occasion, since they were but
temporary, and made up of boards, cloth, etc., painted
and framed on the sudden, but as to outward appearance,
solid and very stately. The night ended with fireworks.
What I saw was that which was built before the
Spanish Ambassador's house, in the Piazza del Trinita,
and another, before that of the French. The first appeared
to be a mighty rock, bearing the Pope's Arms, a
dragon, and divers figures, which being set on fire by one
who flung a rocket at it, kindled immediately, yet preserving
the figure both of the rock and statues a very
long time; insomuch as it was deemed ten thousand reports
of squibs and crackers spent themselves in order.
That before the French Ambassador's Palace was a Diana<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
drawn in a chariot by her dogs, with abundance of other
figures as large as the life, which played with fire in the
same manner. In the meantime, the windows of the
whole city were set with tapers put into lanterns, or
sconces, of several colored oiled paper, that the wind
might not annoy them; this rendered a most glorious
show. Besides these, there were at least twenty other
fireworks of vast charge and rare art for their invention
before divers Ambassadors, Princes, and Cardinals' Palaces,
especially that on the Castle of St. Angelo, being
a pyramid of lights, of great height, fastened to the ropes
and cables which support the standard pole. The streets
were this night as light as day, full of bonfires, cannon
roaring, music playing, fountains running wine, in all
excess of joy and triumph.</p>
