<p>To London, where was a meeting
about Charitable Uses, and particularly to inquire how
the city had disposed of the revenues of Gresham College,
and why the salaries of the professors there were no
better improved. I was on this commission, with divers
Bishops and Lords of the Council; but little was the
progress we could make.</p>
