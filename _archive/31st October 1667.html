<p>My birthdayâ€”blessed be God for
all his mercies! I made the Royal Society a present of
the Table of Veins, Arteries, and Nerves, which great
curiosity I had caused to be made in Italy, out of the
natural human bodies, by a learned physician, and the help
of Veslingius (professor at Padua), from whence I brought
them in 1646. For this I received the public thanks of
the Society; and they are hanging up in their repository
with an inscription.</p>
