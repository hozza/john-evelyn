<p>On the earnest invitation of the Earl
of Essex, I went with him to his house at Cashiobury,
in Hertfordshire. It was on Sunday, but going early
from his house in the square of St. James, we arrived
by ten o'clock; this he thought too late to go to church,
and we had prayers in his chapel. The house is new, a
plain fabric, built by my friend, Mr. Hugh May. There
are divers fair and good rooms, and excellent carving by
Gibbons, especially the chimney-piece of the library.
There is in the porch, or entrance, a painting by Verrio,
of Apollo and the Liberal Arts. One room pargeted
with yew, which I liked well. Some of the chimney
mantels are of Irish marble, brought by my Lord from
Ireland, when he was Lord-Lieutenant, and not much
inferior to Italian. The tympanum, or gable, at the front
is a bass-relievo of Diana hunting, cut in Portland stone,
handsomely enough. I do not approve of the middle
doors being round: but, when the hall is finished as designed,
it being an oval with a cupola, together with
the other wing, it will be a very noble palace. The
library is large, and very nobly furnished, and all the
books are richly bound and gilded; but there are no
MSS., except the Parliament Rolls and Journals, the
transcribing and binding of which cost him, as he assured
me, £500.</p>

<p>No man has been more industrious than this noble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Lord in planting about his seat, adorned with walks, ponds,
and other rural elegancies; but the soil is stony, churlish,
and uneven, nor is the water near enough to the house,
though a very swift and clear stream runs within a flight-shot
from it in the valley, which may fitly be called
Coldbrook, it being indeed excessively cold, yet producing
fair trouts. It is a pity the house was not situated to more
advantage: but it seems it was built just where the old
one was, which I believe he only meant to repair; this
leads men into irremediable errors, and saves but a
little.</p>

<p>The land about is exceedingly addicted to wood, but
the coldness of the place hinders the growth. Black
cherry trees prosper even to considerable timber, some
being eighty feet long; they make also very handsome
avenues. There is a pretty oval at the end of a
fair walk, set about with treble rows of Spanish chestnut
trees.</p>

<p>The gardens are very rare, and cannot be otherwise,
having so skillful an artist to govern them as Mr. Cooke,
who is, as to the mechanic part, not ignorant in mathematics,
and pretends to astrology. There is an excellent
collection of the choicest fruit.</p>

<p>As for my Lord, he is a sober, wise, judicious, and
pondering person, not illiterate beyond the rate of most
noblemen in this age, very well versed in English history
and affairs, industrious, frugal, methodical, and every way
accomplished. His Lady (being sister of the late Earl
of Northumberland) is a wise, yet somewhat melancholy
woman, setting her heart too much on the little lady,
her daughter, of whom she is over fond. They have a
hopeful son at the Academy.</p>

<p>My Lord was not long since come from his Lord-Lieutenancy
of Ireland, where he showed his abilities in
administration and government, as well as prudence in
considerably augmenting his estate without reproach.
He had been Ambassador-extraordinary in Denmark,
and, in a word, such a person as became the son of that
worthy hero his father to be, the late Lord Capel, who
lost his life for King Charles I.</p>

<p>We spent our time in the mornings in walking, or riding,
and contriving [alterations], and the afternoons in the
library, so as I passed my time for three or four days with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
much satisfaction. He was pleased in conversation to
impart to me divers particulars of state, relating to the
present times. He being no great friend to the D——
was now laid aside, his integrity and abilities being not
so suitable in this conjuncture. 21st. I returned to
London.</p>
