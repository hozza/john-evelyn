<p>I was at the betrothal of Lord Arlington's
only daughter (a sweet child if ever there was
any<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_32_32">32</a>) to the Duke of Grafton, the King's natural son by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the Duchess of Cleveland; the Archbishop of Canterbury
officiating, the King and the grandees being present. I
had a favor given me by my Lady; but took no great
joy at the thing for many reasons.</p>
