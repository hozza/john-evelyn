<p>The Bishop of Bath and Wells (Dr.
Ken) preached at <a id="tn_png_275"></a><!--TN: Period added after "St" on Page 262-->St. Martin's to a crowd of people not
to be expressed, nor the wonderful eloquence of this
admirable preacher; the text was Matt. xxvi. 36 to verse
40, describing the bitterness of our Blessed Savior's agony,
the ardor of his love, the infinite obligations we have to
imitate his patience and resignation; the means by watching
against temptations, and over ourselves with fervent
prayer to attain it, and the exceeding reward in the end.
Upon all which he made most pathetical discourses. The
Communion followed, at which I was participant. I
afterward dined at Dr. Tenison's with the Bishop and
that young, most learned, pious, and excellent preacher,
<a id="tn_png_275a"></a><!--TN: Period added after "Mr"-->Mr. Wake. In the afternoon, I went to hear Mr. Wake
at the newly built church of St. Anne, on Mark viii. 34,
upon the subject of taking up the cross, and strenuously
behaving ourselves in time of persecution, as this now
threatened to be.</p>

<p>His Majesty again prorogued the Parliament, foreseeing
it would not remit the laws against Papists, by the extraordinary
zeal and bravery of its members, and the
free renunciation of the great officers both in Court and
state, who would not be prevailed with for any temporal
concern.</p>
