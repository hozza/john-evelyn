<p>I sent my sister my own picture in
water colors,<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18_18">18</a> which she requested of me, and went to see
divers of the fairest palaces of the town, as that of Vendôme,
very large and stately; Lougueville; Guise; Condé;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Chevereuse; Nevers, esteemed one of the best in Paris
toward the river.</p>

<p>I often went to the Palais Cardinal, bequeathed by
Richelieu to the King, on condition that it should be
called by his name; at this time, the King resided in it,
because of the building of the Louvre. It is a very
noble house, though somewhat low; the galleries, paintings
of the most illustrious persons of both sexes, the
Queen's baths, presence-chamber with its rich carved
and gilded roof, theater, and large garden, in which is
an ample fountain, grove, and mall, worthy of remark.
Here I also frequently went to see them ride and exercise
the great horse, especially at the Academy of Monsieur
du Plessis, and de Veau, whose schools of that art
are frequented by the nobility; and here also young gentlemen
are taught to fence, dance, play on music, and
something in fortification and the mathematics. The design
is admirable, some keeping near a hundred brave horses,
all managed to the great saddle.</p>
