<p>The wind continuing N. and E. all
this week, brought so many of our men-of-war together
that, though most of the French finding their design detected
and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb
them; yet they were so engaged among the sands
and flats, that 'tis said they cut their masts and flung
their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels. We
are yet upon them. This deliverance is due solely to
God. French were to have invaded at once England,
Scotland, and Ireland.</p>
