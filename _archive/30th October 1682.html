<p>Being my birthday, and I now entering
my great climacterical of 63, after serious recollections
of the years past, giving Almighty God thanks for
all his merciful preservations and forbearance, begging
pardon for my sins and unworthiness, and his blessing
on me the year entering, I went with my Lady Fox to
survey her building, and give some directions for the
garden at Chiswick; the architect is Mr. May,â€”somewhat
heavy and thick, and not so well understood: the garden
much too narrow, the place without water, near a highway,
and near another great house of my Lord Burlington,
little land about it, so that I wonder at the expense;
but women will have their will.</p>
