<p>I went to see divers gardens about
London: returning, I saw at Dr. Joyliffe's two Virginian
rattlesnakes alive, exceeding a yard in length, small
heads, slender tails, but in the middle nearly the size of
my leg; when vexed, swiftly vibrating and shaking their
tails, as loud as a child's rattle; this, by the collision of
certain gristly skins curiously jointed, yet loose, and
transparent as parchment, by which they give warning;
a providential caution for other creatures to avoid them.
The Doctor tried their biting on rats and mice, which
they immediately killed: but their vigor must needs be
much exhausted here, in another climate, and kept only
in a barrel of bran.</p>
