<p>I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's
with the Earls of Bath, Castlehaven, Lords Viscounts
Falconberg, Falkland, Bishop of London, the Grand Master
of Malta, brother to the Duke de Vend√¥me (a young
wild spark), and Mr. Dryden, the poet. After evening
prayer, I walked in the park with my Lord Clarendon,
where we fell into discourse of the Bishop of Salisbury
(Dr. Seth Ward), his subtlety, etc. Dr. Durell, late Dean
of Windsor, being dead, Dr. Turner, one of the Duke's
chaplains was made dean.</p>

<p>I visited my Lady Arlington, groom of the stole to her
Majesty, who being hardly set down to supper, word was
brought her that the Queen was going into the park to
walk, it being now near eleven at night; the alarm
caused the Countess to rise in all haste, and leave her
supper to us.</p>

<p>By this one may take an estimate of the extreme slavery
and subjection that courtiers live in, who had not
time to eat and drink at their pleasure. It put me in
mind of Horace's "Mouse," and to bless God for my own
private condition.</p>

<p>Here was Monsieur de l'Angle, the famous minister
of Charenton, lately fled from the persecution in France,
concerning the deplorable condition of the Protestants
there.</p>
