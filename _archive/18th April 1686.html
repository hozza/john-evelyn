<p>In the afternoon I went to Camberwell,
to visit Dr. Parr. After sermon, I accompanied
him to his house, where he showed me the Life and
Letters of the late learned Primate of Armagh (Usher),
and among them that letter of Bishop Bramhall's to the
Primate, giving notice of the Popish practices to pervert
this nation, by sending a hundred priests into England,
who were to conform themselves to all sectaries and
conditions for the more easily dispersing their doctrine
among us. This letter was the cause of the whole
impression being seized, upon pretense that it was a political
or historical account of things not relating to theology,
though it had been licensed by the Bishop; which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
plainly showed what an interest the Papists now had,â€”that
a Protestant book, containing the life and letters of
so eminent a man, was not to be published. There were
also many letters to and from most of the learned persons
his correspondents in Europe. The book will, I
doubt not, struggle through this unjust impediment.</p>

<p>Several Judges were put out, and new complying ones
put in.</p>
