<p>I dined at Don Pietro Ronquillo's,
the Spanish Ambassador, at Wild House, who used me
with extraordinary civility. The dinner was plentiful,
half after the Spanish, half after the English way. After
dinner, he led me into his bedchamber, where we fell
into a long discourse concerning religion. Though he
was a learned man in politics, and an advocate, he was
very ignorant in religion, and unable to defend any point
of controversy; he was, however, far from being fierce.
At parting, he earnestly wished me to apply humbly to
the blessed virgin to direct me, assuring me that he
had known divers who had been averse from the Roman
Catholic religion, wonderfully enlightened and convinced
by her intercession. He importuned me to come and
visit him often.</p>
