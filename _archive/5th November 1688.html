<p>I went to London; heard the
news of the Prince having landed at Torbay, coming
with a fleet of near 700 sail, passing through the Channel
with so favorable a wind, that our navy could not
intercept, or molest them. This put the King and Court
into great consternation, they were now employed in
forming an army to stop their further progress, for they
were got into Exeter, and the season and ways very improper
for his Majesty's forces to march so great a distance.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury and some few of the
other Bishops and Lords in London, were sent for to
Whitehall, and required to set forth their abhorrence of
this invasion. They assured his Majesty that they had
never invited any of the Prince's party, or were in the
least privy to it, and would be ready to show all testimony
of their loyalty; but, as to a public declaration,
being so few, they desired that his Majesty would call
the rest of their brethren and Peers, that they might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
consult what was fit to be done on this occasion, not
thinking it right to publish anything without them, and
till they had themselves seen the Prince's manifesto, in
which it was pretended he was invited in by the Lords,
spiritual and temporal. This did not please the King;
so they departed.</p>

<p>A declaration was published, prohibiting all persons to
see or read the Prince's manifesto, in which was set forth
at large the cause of his expedition, as there had been one
before from the States.</p>

<p>These are the beginnings of sorrow, unless God in his
mercy prevent it by some happy reconciliation of all dissensions
among us. This, in all likelihood, nothing can
effect except a free Parliament; but this we cannot hope
to see, while there are any forces on either side. I pray
God to protect and direct the King for the best and
truest interest of his people!â€”I saw his Majesty touch
for the evil, Piten the Jesuit, and Warner officiating.</p>
