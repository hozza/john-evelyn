<p>I went to London with my family, to
celebrate the feast of Easter. Dr. Wild preached at St.
Gregory's; the ruling Powers conniving at the use of the
Liturgy, etc., in the church alone. In the afternoon, Mr.
Pierson (since Bishop of Chester) preached at Eastcheap,
but was disturbed by an alarm of fire, which about this
time was very frequent in the city.</p>
