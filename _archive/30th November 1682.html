and importuned to stand the election,<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_48_48">48</a> having so many

remote dwelling, and now frequent infirmities, I desired
their suffrages might be transferred to Sir John Hoskins,
one of the Masters of Chancery; a most learned virtuoso
as well as lawyer, who accordingly was elected.</p>
