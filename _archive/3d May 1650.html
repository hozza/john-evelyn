<p>At the hospital of La Charit√© I saw the
operation of cutting for the stone. A child of eight or
nine years old underwent the operation with most extraordinary
patience, and expressing great joy when he saw
the stone was drawn. The use I made of it was, to give
Almighty God hearty thanks that I had not been subject
to this deplorable infirmity.</p>
