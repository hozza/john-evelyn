<p>We returned to the Hague, and went
to visit the Hoff, or Prince's Court, with the adjoining
gardens full of ornament, close walks, statues, marbles,
grots, fountains, and artificial music. There is to this
palace a stately hall, not much inferior to ours of Westminster,
hung round with colors and other trophies taken
from the Spaniards;<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12_12">12</a> and the sides below are furnished with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
shops. Next day (the 20th) I returned to Delft, thence
to Rotterdam, the Hague, and Leyden, where immediately
I mounted a wagon, which that night, late as it
was, brought us to Haerlem. <span class="sidenote">AMSTERDAM</span>About seven in the morning
after I came to Amsterdam, where being provided
with a lodging, the first thing I went to see was a Synagogue
of the Jews (being Saturday), whose ceremonies,
ornaments, lamps, law, and schools, afforded matter for
my contemplation. The women were secluded from the
men, being seated in galleries above, shut with lattices,
having their heads muffled with linen, after a fantastical
and somewhat extraordinary fashion; the men, wearing
a large calico mantle, yellow colored, over their hats, all
the while waving their bodies, while at their devotions.
From thence, I went to a place without the town, called
Overkirk, where they have a spacious field assigned them
to bury their dead, full of sepulchers with Hebraic
inscriptions, some of them stately and costly. Looking
through one of these monuments, where the stones were
disjointed, I perceived divers books and papers lie about
a corpse; for it seems, when any learned Rabbi dies,
they bury some of his books with him. With the help
of a stick, I raked out several, written in Hebrew characters,
but much impaired. As we returned, we stepped
in to see the Spin-house, a kind of bridewell, where
incorrigible and lewd women are kept in discipline and
labor, but all neat. We were shown an hospital for
poor travelers and pilgrims, built by Queen Elizabeth of
England; and another maintained by the city.</p>

<p>The State or Senate-house of this town, if the design
be perfected, will be one of the most costly and magnificent
pieces of architecture in Europe, especially for the
materials and the carvings. In the Doole is painted, on
a very large table, the bust of Marie de Medicis, supported
by four royal diadems, the work of one Vanderdall, who
hath set his name thereon, 1st September, 1638.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I heard an English sermon at the Presbyterian
congregation, where they had chalked upon a slate
the psalms that were to be sung, so that all the congregation
might see them without the bidding of a clerk. I
was told, that after such an age no minister was permitted
to preach, but had his maintenance continued during
life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>I purposely changed my lodgings, being desirous to
converse with the sectaries that swarmed in this city,
out of whose spawn came those almost innumerable broods
in England afterward. It was at a Brownist's house,
where we had an <a id="tn_png_049"></a><!--TN: "extrordinary" changed to "extraordinary"-->extraordinary good table. There was in
pension with us my Lord Keeper, Finch, and one Sir J.
Fotherbee. Here I also found an English Carmelite, who
was going through Germany with an Irish gentleman. I
now went to see the Weese-house, a foundation like our
Charter-house, for the education of decayed persons,
orphans, and poor children, where they are taught several
occupations. The girls are so well brought up to
housewifery, that men of good worth, who seek that
chiefly in a woman, frequently take their wives from this
hospital. Thence to the Rasp-house, where the lusty
knaves are compelled to work; and the rasping of brasil
and logwood for the dyers is very hard labor. To the
Dool-house, for madmen and fools. But none did I so
much admire, as an Hospital for their lame and decrepit
soldiers and seamen, where the accommodations are very
great, the building answerable; and, indeed, for the like
public charities the provisions are admirable in this country,
where, as no idle vagabonds are suffered (as in
England they are), there is hardly a child of four or five
years old, but they find some employment for it.</p>

<p>It was on a Sunday morning that I went to the Bourse,
or Exchange, after their sermons were ended, to see the
Dog-market, which lasts till two in the afternoon, in this
place of convention of merchants from all parts of the
world. The building is not comparable to that of London,
built by that worthy citizen, Sir Thomas Gresham, yet
in one respect exceeding it, that vessels of considerable
burden ride at the very quay contiguous to it; and indeed
it is by extraordinary industry that as well this city,
as generally all the towns of Holland, are so accommodated
with graffs, cuts, sluices, moles, and rivers, made
by hand, that nothing is more frequent than to see a
whole navy, belonging to this mercantile people, riding
at anchor before their very doors: and yet their streets
even, straight, and well paved, the houses so uniform
and planted with lime trees, as nothing can be more
beautiful.</p>

<p>The next day we were entertained at a kind of tavern,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
called the Briloft, appertaining to a rich Anabaptist, where,
in the upper rooms of the house, were divers pretty
waterworks, rising 108 feet from the ground. Here were
many quaint devices, fountains, artificial music, noises of
beasts, and chirping of birds; but what pleased me most
was a large pendant candlestick, branching into several
sockets, furnished all with ordinary candles to appearance,
out of the wicks spouting out streams of water, instead
of flames. This seemed then and was a rarity, before
the philosophy of compressed air made it intelligible.
There was likewise a cylinder that entertained the company
with a variety of chimes, the hammers striking upon
the brims of porcelain dishes, suited to the tones and notes,
without cracking any of them. Many other waterworks
were shown.</p>

<p>The Kaiser's or Emperor's Graft, which is an ample
and long street, appearing like a city in a forest; the lime
trees planted just before each house, and at the margin
of that goodly aqueduct so curiously wharfed with Klincard
brick, which likewise paves the streets, than which
nothing can be more useful and neat. This part of Amsterdam
is built and gained upon the main sea, supported
by piles at an immense charge, and fitted for the most
busy concourse of traffickers and people of commerce beyond
any place, or mart, in the world. Nor must I forget
the port of entrance into an issue of this town, composed
of very magnificent pieces of architecture, some of the
ancient and best manner, as are divers churches.</p>

<p>The turrets, or steeples, are adorned after a particular
manner and invention; the chimes of bells are so rarely
managed, that being curious to know whether the motion
was from any engine, I went up to that of St. Nicholas,
where I found one who played all sorts of compositions
from the tablature before him, as if he had fingered an
organ; for so were the hammers fastened with wires to
several keys put into a frame twenty feet below the bells,
upon which (by the help of a wooden instrument, not
much unlike a weaver's shuttle, that guarded his hand)
he struck on the keys and played to admiration. All this
while, through the clattering of the wires, din of the too
nearly sounding bells, and noise that his wooden gloves
made, the confusion was so great, that it was impossible
for the musician, or any that stood near him, to hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
anything at all; yet, to those at a distance, and especially
in the streets, the harmony and the time were the
most exact and agreeable.</p>

<p>The south church is richly paved with black and white
marble,â€”the west is a new fabric; and generally all the
churches in Holland are furnished with organs, lamps,
and monuments, carefully preserved from the fury and
impiety of popular reformers, whose zeal has foolishly
transported them in other places rather to act like madmen
than religious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAERLEM</div>

<p>Upon St. Bartholomew's day, I went among the booksellers,
and visited the famous Hondius and Bleaw's shop,
to buy some maps, atlases, and other works of that kind.
At another shop, I furnished myself with some shells and
Indian curiosities; and so, toward the end of August, I
returned again to Haerlem by the river, ten miles in
length, straight as a line, and of competent breadth for
ships to sail by one another. They showed us a cottage
where, they told us, dwelt a woman who had been married
to her twenty-fifth husband, and being now a widow, was
prohibited to marry in future; yet it could not be proved
that she had ever made away with any of her husbands,
though the suspicion had brought her divers times to trouble.</p>

<p>Haerlem is a very delicate town and hath one of the
fairest churches of the Gothic design I had ever seen.
There hang in the steeple, which is very high, two silver
bells, said to have been brought from Damietta, in Egypt,
by an earl of Holland, in memory of whose success they
are rung out every evening. In the nave hang the goodliest
branches of brass for tapers that I have seen, esteemed
of great value for the curiosity of the workmanship; also a
fair pair of organs, which I could not find they made use of
in divine service, or so much as to assist them in singing
psalms, but only for show, and to recreate the people
before and after their devotions, while the burgomasters
were walking and conferring about their affairs. Near the
west window hang two models of ships, completely
equipped, in memory of that invention of saws under
their keels, with which they cut through the chain of
booms, which barred the port of Damietta. <span class="sidenote">LEYDEN</span>Having visited
this church, the fish-market, and made some inquiry about
the printing-house, the invention whereof is said to have
been in this town, I returned to Leyden.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>



<p>At Leyden, I was carried up to the castle, or Pyrgus,
built on a very steep artificial mount, cast up (as reported)
by Hengist the Saxon, on his return out of England,
as a place to retire to, in case of any sudden inundations.</p>

<p>The churches are many and fair; in one of them lies
buried the learned and illustrious Joseph Scaliger, without
any extraordinary inscription, who, having left the world
a monument of his worth more lasting than marble, needed
nothing more than his own name; which I think is all
engraven on his sepulcher. He left his library to this
University.</p>
