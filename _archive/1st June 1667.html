<p>I went to Greenwich, where his Majesty
was trying divers grenadoes shot out of cannon at the
Castlehill, from the house in the park; they broke not till
they hit the mark, the forged ones broke not at all, but
the cast ones very well. The inventor was a German there
present. At the same time, a ring was shown to the
King, pretended to be a projection of mercury, and malleable,
and said by the gentlemen to be fixed by the juice
of a plant.</p>
