<p>I went to Wotton with my Son and
his tutor, Mr. Bohun, Fellow of New College (recommended
to me by Dr. Wilkins, and the President of New
College, Oxford), for fear of the pestilence, still increasing
in London and its environs. On my return, I called at
Durdans, where I found Dr. Wilkins, Sir William Petty,
and Mr. Hooke, contriving chariots, new rigging for ships,
a wheel for one to run races in, and other mechanical inventions;
perhaps three such persons together were not to
be found elsewhere in Europe, for parts and ingenuity.</p>
