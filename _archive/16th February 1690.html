<p>The Duchess of Monmouth's
chaplain preached at St. Martin's an excellent discourse
exhorting to peace and sanctity, it being now the time
of very great division and dissension in the nation; first,
among the Churchmen, of whom the moderate and sober
part were for a speedy reformation of divers things,
which it was thought might be made in our Liturgy,
for the inviting of Dissenters; others more stiff and
rigid, were for no condescension at all. Books and
pamphlets were published every day pro and con; the
Convocation were forced for the present to suspend any
further progress. There was fierce and great carousing
about being elected in the new Parliament. The King
persists in his intention of going in person for Ireland,
whither the French are sending supplies to King James,
and we, the Danish horse to Schomberg.</p>
