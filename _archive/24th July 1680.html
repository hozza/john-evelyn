<p>Went with my wife and daughter to
Windsor, to see that stately court, now near finished.
There was erected in the court the King on horseback,
lately cast in copper, and set on a rich pedestal of white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
marble, the work of Mr. Gibbons, at the expense of Toby
Rustate, a page of the back stairs, who by his wonderful
frugality had arrived to a great estate in money, and
did many works of charity, as well as this of gratitude
to his master, which cost him Â£1,000. He is very simple,
ignorant, but honest and loyal creature.</p>

<p>We all dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, afterward
to see Signor Verrio's garden, thence to Eton College,
to salute the provost, and heard a Latin speech of
one of the alumni (it being at the election) and were
invited to supper; but took our leave, and got to London
that night in good time.</p>
