<p>To Chichester, and hence the next
day to see the siege of Portsmouth; for now was that
bloody difference between the King and Parliament
broken out, which ended in the fatal tragedy so many
years after. It was on the day of its being rendered to
Sir William Waller; which gave me an opportunity of
taking my leave of Colonel Goring, the governor, now
embarking for France. This day was fought that signal
battle at Edgehill. Thence I went to Southampton and
Winchester, where I visited the castle, school, church,
and King Arthur's Round Table; but especially the
church, and its Saxon kings' monuments, which I esteemed
a worthy antiquity.</p>

<p>The 12th of November was the battle of Brentford, surprisingly
fought; and to the great consternation of the
City, had his Majesty (as it was believed he would)
pursued his advantage. I came in with my horse and
arms just at the retreat; but was not permitted to stay
longer than the 15th, by reason of the army marching
to Gloucester; which would have left both me and my
brothers exposed to ruin, without any advantage to his
Majesty.</p>
