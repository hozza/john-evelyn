<p>This day was ordered a general
Fast through the Nation, to humble us on the late dreadful
conflagration, added to the plague and war, the most
dismal judgments that could be inflicted; but which indeed
we highly deserved for our prodigious ingratitude, burning
lusts, dissolute court, profane and abominable lives, under
such dispensations of God's continued favor in restoring
Church, Prince, and People from our late intestine calamities,
of which we were altogether unmindful, even to
astonishment. This made me resolve to go to our parish
assembly, where our Doctor preached on <a id="tn_png_035"></a><!--TN: "Luke, xix," changed to "Luke xix." on Page 26-->Luke xix. 41:
piously applying it to the occasion. After which, was a
collection for the distressed losers in the late fire.</p>
