at Sayes Court. Now was the Thames frozen over,
and horrid tempests of wind.</p>

<p>The villany of the rebels proceeding now so far as to
try, condemn, and murder our excellent King on the
30th of this month, struck me with such horror, that I
kept the day of his martyrdom a fast, and would not be
present at that execrable wickedness; receiving the sad
account of it from my brother George, and Mr.Â Owen,
who came to visit me this afternoon, and recounted all
the circumstances.</p>
