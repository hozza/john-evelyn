<p>I went in a coach, it being excessive
sharp frost and snow, toward Dover and other parts of
Kent, to settle physicians, chirurgeons, agents, marshals,
and other officers in all the sea ports, to take care of such
as should be set on shore, wounded, sick, or prisoners, in
pursuance of our commission reaching from the North
Foreland, in Kent, to Portsmouth, in Hampshire. The rest
of the ports in England were allotted to the other Commissioners.
That evening I came to Rochester, where I
delivered the Privy Council's letter to the Mayor to receive
orders from me.</p>
