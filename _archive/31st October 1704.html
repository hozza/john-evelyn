<p>Being my birthday and the 84th
year of my life, after particular reflections on my concerns
and passages of the year, I set some considerable time
of this day apart, to recollect and examine my state and
condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing,
and imploring his protection for the year following.</p>

<p>December, 1704. Lord Clarendon presented me with
the three volumes of his father's "History of the Rebellion."</p>

<p>My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for
Mr. Clarke's continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture,
which I willingly gave for his excellent performance of
this year.</p>
