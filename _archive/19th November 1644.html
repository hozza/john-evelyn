<p>I visited St. Peter's, that most
stupendous and incomparable Basilica, far surpassing any
now extant in the world, and perhaps, Solomon's Temple
excepted, any that was ever built. The largeness of the
piazza before the portico is worth observing, because it
affords a noble prospect of the church, not crowded up,
as for the most part is the case in other places where
great churches are erected. In this is a fountain, out of
which gushes a river rather than a stream which, ascending
a good height, breaks upon a round emboss of marble
into millions of pearls that fall into the subjacent basins
with great noise; I esteem this one of the goodliest fountains
I ever saw.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Next is the obelisk transported out of Egypt, and dedicated
by Octavius Augustus to Julius Cæsar, whose
ashes it formerly bore on the summit; but, being since
overturned by the barbarians, was re-erected with vast
cost and a most stupendous invention by Domenico
Fontana, architect to Sextus V. The obelisk consists of
one entire square stone without hieroglyphics, in height
seventy-two feet, but comprehending the base and all it
is 108 feet high, and rests on four lions of gilded copper,
so as you may see through the base of the obelisk and
plinth of the pedestal.</p>

<p>Upon two faces of the obelisk is engraven</p>

<p class="centerquot" style="line-height:1.4">

<p>It now bears on the top a cross in which it is said
that Sextus V. inclosed some of the holy wood; and under
it is to be read by good eyes:</p>

<p class="centerquot" style="line-height:1.4">

<p>It is reported to have taken a year in erecting, to have
cost 37,975 crowns, the labor of 907 men, and 75 horses:
this being the first of the four Egyptian obelisks set up
at Rome, and one of the forty-two brought to the city
out of Egypt, set up in several places, but thrown down
by the Goths, Barbarians, and earthquakes. Some coaches
stood before the steps of the ascent, whereof one, belonging
to Cardinal Medici, had all the metal work of massy
silver, viz, the bow behind and other places. The coaches
at Rome, as well as covered wagons also much in use,
are generally the richest and largest I ever saw. Before
the <i>facciata</i> of the church is an ample pavement. The
church was first begun by St. Anacletus, when rather a
chapel, on a foundation, as they give out, of Constantine
the Great, who, in honor of the Apostles, carried
twelve baskets full of sand to the work. After him,
Julius II. took it in hand, to which all his successors
have contributed more or less.</p>

<p>The front is supposed to be the largest and best-studied
piece of architecture in the world; to this we
went up by four steps of marble. The first entrance is
supported by huge pilasters; the <i>volto</i> within is the richest
possible, and overlaid with gold. Between the five
large anti-ports are columns of enormous height and
compass, with as many gates of brass, the work and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
sculpture of Pollaivola, the Florentine, full of cast figures
and histories in a deep relievo. Over this runs a terrace
of like amplitude and ornament, where the Pope, at
solemn times, bestows his Benediction on the vulgar.
On each side of this portico are two <i>campaniles</i>, or
towers, whereof there was but one perfected, of admirable
art. On the top of all, runs a balustrade which
edges it quite round, and upon this at equal distances
are Christ and the twelve Disciples of gigantic size and
stature, yet below showing no greater than the life.
Entering the church, admirable is the breadth of the
<i>volto</i>, or roof, which is all carved with foliage and roses
overlaid with gold in nature of a deep basso-relievo, <i>à
l'antique</i>. The nave, or body, is in form of a cross,
whereof the foot-part is the longest; and, at the <i>internodium</i>
of the transept, rises the cupola, which being all
of stone and of prodigious height is more in compass
than that of the Pantheon (which was the largest among
the old Romans, and is yet entire) or any other known.
The inside, or concave, is covered with most exquisite
Mosaic, representing the Celestial Hierarchy, by Giuseppe
<a id="tn_png_146"></a><!--TN: "d Arpino" changed to "d'Arpino"-->d'Arpino, full of stars of gold; the convex, or outside,
exposed to the air, is covered with lead, with great ribs
of metal double gilt (as are also the ten other lesser
cupolas, for no fewer adorn this glorious structure),
which gives a great and admirable splendor in all parts
of the city. On the summit of this is fixed a brazen globe
gilt, capable of receiving thirty-five persons. This I
entered, and engraved my name among other travelers.
Lastly, is the Cross, the access to which is between the
leaden covering and the stone convex, or arch-work; a
most truly astonishing piece of art! On the battlements
of the church, also all overlaid with lead and marble,
you would imagine yourself in a town, so many are the
cupolas, pinnacles, towers, juttings, and not a few houses
inhabited by men who dwell there, and have enough to
do to look after the vast reparations which continually
employ them.</p>

<p>Having seen this, we descended into the body of the
church, full of collateral chapels and large oratories, most
of them exceeding the size of ordinary churches; but the
principal are four incrusted with most precious marbles
and stones of various colors, adorned with an infinity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
statues, pictures, stately altars, and innumerable relics.
The altar-piece of St. Michael being of Mosaic, I could
not pass without particular note, as one of the best of
that kind. The chapel of Gregory XIII., where he is
buried, is most splendid. Under the cupola, and in the
center of the church, stands the high altar, consecrated
first by Clement VIII., adorned by Paul V., and lately
covered by Pope Urban VIII.; with that stupendous
canopy of Corinthian brass, which heretofore was brought
from the Pantheon; it consists of four wreathed columns,
partly channelled and encircled with vines, on which
hang little <i>puti</i> birds and bees (the arms of the <i>Barberini</i>),
sustaining a <i>baldacchino</i> of the same metal. The
four columns weigh an hundred and ten thousand pounds,
all over richly gilt; this, with the pedestals, crown, and
statues about it, form a thing of that art, vastness, and
magnificence, as is beyond all that man's industry has
produced of the kind; it is the work of Bernini, a Florentine
sculptor, architect, painter, and poet, who, a little
before my coming to the city, gave a public opera (for
so they call shows of that kind), wherein he painted the
scenes, cut the statues, invented the engines, composed
the music, writ the comedy, and built the theater. Opposite
to either of these pillars, under those niches which,
with their columns, support the weighty cupola, are
placed four exquisite statues of Parian marble, to which
are four altars; that of St. Veronica, made by Fra. Mochi,
has over it the reliquary, where they showed us the
miraculous <i>Sudarium</i> indued with the picture of our Savior's
face, with this inscription: "<i>Salvatoris imaginem Veronicæ
Sudario exceptam ut loci majestas decentèr custodiret,
Urbanus VIII. Pont. Max. Marmoreum signum et Altare
addidit, Conditorium extruxit et ornavit</i>."</p>

<p>Right against this is that of Longinus, of a Colossean
magnitude, also by Bernini, and over him the conservatory
of the iron lance inserted in a most precious crystal,
with this epigraph: "<i>Longini Lanceam quam Innocentius
VIII. à Bajazete Turcarum Tyranno accepit, Urbanus VIII.
statuâ appositâ, et Sacello substructo, in exornatum Conditorium
transtulit</i>."</p>

<p>The third chapel has over the altar the statue of our
countrywoman, St. Helena, the mother of Constantine the
Great; the work of Boggi, an excellent sculptor; and here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
is preserved a great piece of the pretended wood of the
holy cross, which she is said to have first detected miraculously
in the Holy Land. It was placed here by the late
Pope with this inscription: "<i>Partem Crucis quam Helena
Imperatrix è Calvario in Urbem adduxit, Urbanus VIII.
Pont. Max. è Sissorianâ Basilicâ desumptam, additis arâ et
statuâ, hìc in Vaticano collocavit</i>."</p>

<p>The fourth hath over the altar, and opposite to that
of St. Veronica, the statue of St. Andrew, the work of
Fiamingo, admirable above all the other; above is preserved
the head of that Apostle, richly enchased. It is
said that this excellent sculptor died mad to see his
statue placed in a disadvantageous light by Bernini, the
chief architect, who found himself outdone by this artist.
The inscription over it is this:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>St. Andreæ caput quod Pius II. ex Achaiâ in Vaticanum asportandum
curavit, Urbanus VIII. novis hic ornamentis decoratum
sacrisque statuæ ac Sacelli honoribus coli voluit.</i>"</p>

<p>The relics showed and kept in this church are without
number, as are also the precious vessels of gold, silver,
and gems, with the vests and services to be seen in the
Sacristy, which they showed us. Under the high altar
is an ample grot inlaid with <i>pietra-commessa</i>, wherein
half of the bodies of St. Peter and St. Paul are preserved;
before hang divers great lamps of the richest
plate, burning continually. About this and contiguous
to the altar, runs a balustrade, in form of a theater, of
black marble. Toward the left, as you go out of the
church by the portico, a little beneath the high altar, is
an old brass statue of St. Peter sitting, under the soles
of whose feet many devout persons rub their heads, and
touch their chaplets. This was formerly cast from a
statue of Jupiter Capitolinus. In another place, stands
a column grated about with iron, whereon they report
that our Blessed Savior was often wont to lean as he
preached in the Temple. In the work of the reliquary
under the cupola there are eight wreathed columns
brought from the Temple of Solomon. In another
chapel, they showed us the chair of St. Peter, or, as
they name it, the Apostolical Throne. But among all the
chapels the one most glorious has for an altar-piece a
Madonna bearing a dead Christ on her knees, in white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
marble, the work of Michael Angelo. At the upper end
of the Cathedral, are several stately monuments, especially
that of Urban VIII. Round the cupola, and in
many other places in the church, are confession seats,
for all languages, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian,
French, English, Irish, Welsh, Sclavonian, Dutch, etc., as
it is written on their friezes in golden capitals, and there
are still at confessions some of all nations. Toward the
lower end of the church, and on the side of a vast pillar
sustaining a weighty roof, is the <i>depositum</i> and statue of
the Countess Matilda, a rare piece, with basso-relievos
about it of white marble, the work of Bernini. Here
are also those of Sextus IV. and Paulus III., etc.
Among the exquisite pieces in this sumptuous fabric is
that of the ship with St. Peter held up from sinking by
our Savior; the emblems about it are the Mosaic of the
famous Giotto, who restored and made it perfect after
it had been defaced by the Barbarians. Nor is the
pavement under the cupola to be passed over without
observation, which with the rest of the body and walls
of the whole church, are all inlaid with the richest of
<i>pietra-commessa</i>, in the most splendid colors of polished
marbles, agates, serpentine, porphyry, calcedon, etc.,
wholly incrusted to the very roof. Coming out by the
portico at which we entered, we were shown the Porta
Santa, never opened but at the year of jubilee. This
glorious foundation hath belonging to it thirty canons,
thirty-six beneficiates, twenty-eight clerks beneficed, with
innumerable chaplains, etc., a Cardinal being always
archpriest; the present Cardinal was Francisco Barberini,
who also styled himself Protector of the English, to whom
he was indeed very courteous.</p>
