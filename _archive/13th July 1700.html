<p>I went to Harden, which was originally
a barren warren bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who
built there a pretty house, and made such alteration by
planting not only an infinite store of the best fruit; but
so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys,
and solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented
some foreign country, which would produce spontaneously
pines, firs, cypress, yew, holly, and juniper;
they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the
utmost care, so that I who had seen it some years before
in its naked and barren condition, was in admiration of it.
The land was bought of Sir John Evelyn, of Godstone,
and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement by
the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen. He
and his lady received us with great civility. The tombs
in the church at Croydon of Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift,
and other Archbishops, are fine and venerable; but
none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance
and carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge
could not cost less than £700 or £800.</p>
