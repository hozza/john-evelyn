<p>We arrived at Roane, where we
quitted our guide, and took post for Lyons. Roane
seemed to me one of the pleasantest and most agreeable
places imaginable, for a retired person: for, besides the
situation on the Loire, there are excellent provisions
cheap and abundant. It being late when we left this
town, we rode no further than Tarare that night (passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
St. Saforin), a little desolate village in a valley near a
pleasant stream, encompassed with fresh meadows and
vineyards. The hills which we rode over before we descended,
and afterward, on the Lyons side of this place,
are high and mountainous; fir and pines growing frequently
on them. The air methought was much altered
as well as the manner of the houses, which are built
flatter, more after the eastern manner. Before I went
to bed, I took a landscape of this pleasant terrace. There
followed a most violent tempest of thunder and lightning.</p>
