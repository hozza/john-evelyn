<p>It was about three in the afternoon,
I took oars for Gravesend, accompanied by my cousin,
Stephens, and sister, Glanville, who there supped with
me and returned; whence I took post immediately to
Dover, where I arrived by nine in the morning; and,
about eleven that night, went on board a barque guarded
by a pinnace of eight guns; this being the first time the
Packet-boat had obtained a convoy, having several times
before been pillaged. We had a good passage, though
chased for some hours by a pirate, but he dared not
attack our frigate, and we then chased him till he got
under the protection of the castle at Calais. It was a
small privateer belonging to the Prince of Wales. I
carried over with me my servant, Richard Hoare, an
incomparable writer of several hands, whom I afterward
preferred in the Prerogative Office, at the return of his
Majesty. Lady Catherine Scott, daughter of the Earl of
Norwich, followed us in a shallop, with Mr.Â Arthur
Slingsby, who left England <i>incognito</i>. At the entrance
of the town, the Lieutenant Governor, being on his horse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
with the guards, let us pass courteously. I visited Sir
Richard Lloyd, an English gentleman, and walked in the
church, where the ornament about the high altar of black
marble is very fine, and there is a good picture of the
Assumption. The citadel seems to be impregnable, and
the whole country about it to be laid under water by
sluices for many miles.</p>
