<p><span class="smcap">Sunday.</span> I went to prayer in
the chapel, and heard Dr. Standish. The second
sermon was preached by Dr. Creighton, on 1 Thess. iv.
11, persuading to unity and peace, and to be mindful of
our own business, according to the advice of the
apostle. Then I went to hear a Frenchman who
preached before the King and Queen in that splendid
chapel next St. George's Hall. Their Majesties going
to mass, I withdrew to consider the stupendous painting
of the Hall, which, both for the art and invention, deserve
the inscription in honor of the painter, Signor Verrio.
The history is Edward III. receiving the Black Prince,
coming toward him in a Roman triumph. The whole
roof is the history of St. George. The throne, the
carvings, etc., are incomparable, and I think equal to
any, and in many circumstances exceeding any, I have
seen abroad.</p>

<p>I dined at Lord Sunderland's, with (among others) Sir
William Soames, designed Ambassador to Constantinople.</p>

<p>About 6 o'clock came Sir Dudley and his brother Roger
North, and brought the Great Seal from my Lord Keeper,
who died the day before at his house in Oxfordshire.
The King went immediately to council; everybody guessing
who was most likely to succeed this great officer;
most believing it could be no other than my Lord Chief
Justice Jefferies, who had so vigorously prosecuted the
late rebels, and was now gone the Western Circuit, to
punish the rest that were secured in several counties, and
was now near upon his return. I took my leave of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Majesty, who spoke very graciously to me, and supping
that night at Sir Stephen Fox's, I promised to dine there
the next day.</p>
