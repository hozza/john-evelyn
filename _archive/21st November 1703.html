<p>The wet and uncomfortable
weather staying us from church this morning, our Doctor
officiated in my family; at which were present above
twenty domestics. He made an excellent discourse on 1
Cor. xv., v. 55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty
of life, and the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction
of a holy life, with pertinent inferences to prepare
us for death and a future state. I gave him thanks, and
told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.</p>

<p>26-7th November, 1703. The effects of the hurricane
and tempest of wind, rain, and lightning, through all
the nation, especially London, were very dismal. Many
houses demolished, and people killed. As to my own
losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental
and valuable, through my whole estate, and about
my house the woods crowning the garden mount, the
growing along the park meadow, the damage to my own
dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to
be paralleled, with anything happening in our age. I
am not able to describe it; but submit to the pleasure
of Almighty God.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>
