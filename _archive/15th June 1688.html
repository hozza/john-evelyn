<p>Being the first day of term, the
Bishops were brought to Westminster on habeas corpus,
when the indictment was read, and they were called on to
plead; their counsel objected that the warrant was illegal;
but, after long debate, it was overruled, and they pleaded.
The Court then offered to take bail for their appearance;
but this they refused, and at last were dismissed on their
own recognizances to appear that day fortnight; the
Archbishop in £200, the Bishops in £100 each.</p>
