<p>Trinity Sunday, I was absent from
church in the afternoon on a charitable affair for the
Abbess of Bourcharvant, who but for me had been abused
by that chemist, Du Menie. Returning, I stepped into the
Grand Jesuits, who had this high day exposed their Cibarium,
made all of solid gold and imagery, a piece of infinite
cost. Dr. Croydon, coming out of Italy and from Padua,
came to see me, on his return to England.</p>
