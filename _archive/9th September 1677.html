<p>A stranger preached at Euston
Church, and fell into a handsome panegyric on my Lord's
new building the church, which indeed for its elegance
and cheerfulness, is one of the prettiest country churches
in England. My Lord told me his heart smote him that,
after he had bestowed so much on his magnificent palace
there, he should see God's House in the ruin it lay in.
He has also rebuilt the parsonage-house, all of stone,
very neat and ample.</p>
