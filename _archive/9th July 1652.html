<p>We went to see Penshurst, the Earl
of Leicester's, famous once for its gardens and excellent
fruit, and for the noble conversation which was
wont to meet there, celebrated by that illustrious person,
Sir Philip Sidney, who there composed divers of
his pieces. It stands in a park, is finely watered, and
was now full of company, on the marriage of my old
fellow-collegiate, Mr.Â Robert Smith, who married my
Lady Dorothy Sidney, widow of the Earl of Sunderland.</p>

<p>One of the men who robbed me was taken; I was accordingly
summoned to appear against him; and, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
12th, was in Westminster Hall, but not being bound
over, nor willing to hang the fellow, I did not appear,
coming only to save a friend's bail; but the bill being
found, he was turned over to the Old Bailey. In the
meantime, I received a petition from the prisoner, whose
father I understood was an honest old farmer in Kent.
He was charged, with other crimes, and condemned, but
reprieved. I heard afterward that, had it not been for
his companion, a younger man, he would probably have
killed me. He was afterward charged with some other
crime, but, refusing to plead, was pressed to death.</p>
