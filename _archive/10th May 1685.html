<p>The Scots valuing themselves exceedingly
to have been the first Parliament called by his
Majesty, gave the excise and customs to him and his
successors forever; the Duke of Queensberry making eloquent

who had done such unheard of assassinations. In the
meantime, elections for the ensuing Parliament in England
were thought to be very indirectly carried on in
most places. God grant a better issue of it than some
expect!</p>
