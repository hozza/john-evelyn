<p>I went to hear a sermon at St.
Giacomo degli Incurabili, a fair church built by F. da
Volterra, of good architecture, and so is the hospital,
where only desperate patients are brought. I passed the
evening at St. Maria del Popolo, heretofore Nero's
sepulchre, where his ashes lay many years in a marble
chest. To this church joins the monastery of St. Augustine,
which has pretty gardens on Mons Pincius, and in
the church is the miraculous shrine of the Madonna
which Pope Paul III. brought barefooted to the place,
supplicating for a victory over the Turks in 1464. In a
chapel of the Ghisi, are some rare paintings of Raphael,
and noble sculptures. Those two in the choir are by
Sansovino, and in the Chapel de Cerasii, a piece of Caravaggio.
Here lie buried many great scholars and artists,
of which I took notice of this inscription:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="ia">"<i>Hospes, disce novum mortis genus; improba felis,</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Dum trahitur, digitum mordet, et intereo.</i>"</span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>

</p><p>Opposite to the <i>facciátæ</i> of the church is a superb
obelisk full of hieroglyphics, the same that Sennesertus,
King of Egypt, dedicated to the Sun; brought to Rome
by Augustus, erected in the Circus Maximus, and since
placed here by Pope Sextus V. It is eighty-eight feet
high, of one entire stone, and placed with great art and
engines by the famous Domenico Fontana.</p>

<p>Hence, turning on the right out of the Porto del
Popolo, we came to Justinian's gardens, near the Muro
Torto, so prominently built as threatening every moment
to fall, yet standing so for these thousand years. Under
this is the burying place for the common prostitutes,
where they are put into the ground, <i>sans ceremonie</i>.</p>
