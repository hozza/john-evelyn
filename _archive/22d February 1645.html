<p>I went to Trinit√° del Monte, a
monastery of French, a noble church built by Louis XI.
and Charles VIII., the chapels well painted, especially
that by Zaccara da Volterra, and the cloister with the
miracles of their St. Francis de Paulo, and the heads of
the French Kings. In the <i>pergolo</i> above, the walls are
wrought with excellent perspective, especially the St.
John; there are the Babylonish dials, invented by Kircher,
the Jesuit. This convent, so eminently situated
on Mons Pincius, has the entire prospect of Campus
Martius, and has a fair garden which joins to the Palazzo
di Medici.</p>
