<p>Called upon my Lord Arlington, as from
his Majesty, about the new fuel. The occasion why I was
mentioned, was from what I said in my <i>Sylva</i> three years
before, about a sort of fuel for a need, which obstructed a
patent of Lord Carlingford, who had been seeking for it
himself; he was endeavoring to bring me into the project,
and proffered me a share. I met my Lord; and, on
the 9th, by an order of Council, went to my Lord Mayor,
to be assisting. In the meantime they had made an experiment
of my receipt of <i>houllies</i>, which I mention in my
book to be made at Maestricht, with a mixture of charcoal
dust and loam, and which was tried with success at Gresham
College (then being the exchange for the meeting of the
merchants since the fire) for everybody to see. This
done, I went to the Treasury for £12,000 for the sick and
wounded yet on my hands.</p>

<p>Next day, we met again about the fuel at Sir J. Armourer's
in the Mews.</p>
