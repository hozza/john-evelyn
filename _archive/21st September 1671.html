<p>I dined in the city, at the fraternity
feast in Ironmongers' Hall, where the four stewards
chose their successors for the next year, with
a solemn procession, garlands about their heads, and
music playing before them; so, coming up to the upper
tables where the gentlemen sat, they drank to the new
stewards; and so we parted.</p>
