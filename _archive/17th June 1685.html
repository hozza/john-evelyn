<p>The Duke landed with but 150 men;
but the whole kingdom was alarmed, fearing that the
disaffected would join them, many of the trained bands
flocking to him. At his landing, he published a Declaration,
charging his Majesty with usurpation and several
horrid crimes, on pretense of his own title, and offering
to call a free Parliament. This declaration was ordered
to be burnt by the hangman, the Duke proclaimed a
traitor, and a reward of Â£5,000 to any who should kill
him.</p>

<p>At this time, the words engraved on the monument in
London, intimating that the Papists fired the city, were
erased and cut out.</p>

<p>The exceeding drought still continues.</p>
