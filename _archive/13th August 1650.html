<p>At six in the evening, set sail for
Calais; the wind not favorable, I was very sea-sick, coming
to an anchor about one o'clock; about five in the
morning, we had a long boat to carry us to land, though
at a good distance; this we willingly entered, because
two vessels were chasing us; but, being now almost
at the harbor's mouth, through inadvertency there broke
in upon us two such heavy seas, as had almost sunk the
boat, I being near the middle up in water. Our steersman,
it seems, apprehensive of the danger, was preparing
to leap into the sea and trust to swimming, but seeing
the vessel emerge, he put her into the pier, and so, God
be thanked! we got to Calais, though wet.</p>

<p>Here I waited for company, the passage toward Paris
being still infested with volunteers from the Spanish
frontiers.</p>
