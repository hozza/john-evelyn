<p>To Mr. Hewer's at Clapham, where
he has an excellent, useful, and capacious house on the
Common, built by Sir Den. Gauden, and by him sold to
Mr. Hewer, who got a very considerable estate in the
Navy, in which, from being Mr. Pepys's clerk, he came
to be one of the principal officers, but was put out of all
employment on the Revolution, as were all the best
officers, on suspicion of being no friends to the change;
such were put in their places, as were most shamefully
ignorant and unfit. Mr. Hewer lives very handsomely
and friendly to everybody. Our fleet was now sailing
on their long pretense of a descent on the French coast;
but, after having sailed one hundred leagues, returned,
the admiral and officers disagreeing as to the place where
they were to land, and the time of year being so far
spent,â€”to the great dishonor of those at the helm, who
concerted their matters so indiscreetly, or, as some
thought, designedly.</p>

<p>This whole summer was exceedingly wet and rainy, the
like had not been known since the year 1648; while in
Ireland they had not known so great a drought.</p>
