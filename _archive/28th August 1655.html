<p>Came that renowned mathematician,
Mr.Â Oughtred, to see me, I sending my coach to bring him
to Wotton, being now very aged. Among other discourse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
he told me he thought water to be the philosopher's first
matter, and that he was well persuaded of the possibility
of their elixir; he believed the sun to be a material fire,
the moon a continent, as appears by the late selenographers;
he had strong apprehensions of some extraordinary
event to happen the following year, from the
calculation of coincidence with the diluvian period; and
added that it might possibly be to convert the Jews by our
Savior's visible appearance, or to judge the world; and
therefore, his word was, "<i>Parate in occursum</i>"; he said
original sin was not met with in the Greek Fathers, yet
he believed the thing; this was from some discourse on
Dr. Taylor's late book, which I had lent him.</p>
