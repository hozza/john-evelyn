<p>I went to take leave of the two Mr.
Howards, now going to Paris, and brought them as far
as Bromley; thence to Eltham, to see Sir John Shaw's
new house, now building; the place is pleasant, if not too
wet, but the house not well contrived; especially the
roof and rooms too low pitched, and the kitchen where
the cellars should be; the orangery and aviary handsome,
and a very large plantation about it.</p>
