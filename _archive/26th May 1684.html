<p>Lord Dartmouth was chosen Master
of the Trinity Company, newly returned with the fleet
from blowing up and demolishing Tangier. In the sermon
preached on this occasion, Dr. Can observed that,
in the 27th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, the casting
anchor out of the fore ship had been caviled at as
betraying total ignorance: that it is very true our seamen
do not do so; but in the Mediterranean their ships were
built differently from ours, and to this day it was the
practice to do so there.</p>

<p>Luxemburg was surrendered to the French, which
makes them master of all the Netherlands, gives them
entrance into Germany, and a fair game for universal
monarchy; which that we should suffer, who only and
easily might have hindered, astonished all the world.
Thus is the poor Prince of Orange ruined, and this nation
and all the Protestant interest in Europe following, unless
God in his infinite mercy, as by a miracle, interpose,
and our great ones alter their counsels. The French
fleet were now besieging Genoa, but after burning much
of that beautiful city with their bombs, went off with
disgrace.</p>
