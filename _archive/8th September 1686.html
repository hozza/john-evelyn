<p>Dr. Compton, Bishop of London,
was on Monday suspended, on pretense of not silencing
Dr. Sharp at St. Giles's, for something of a sermon in
which he zealously reproved the doctrine of the Roman
Catholics. The Bishop having consulted the civilians,
they told him he could not by any law proceed against
Dr. Sharp without producing witnesses, and impleaded
according to form; but it was overruled by my Lord
Chancellor, and the Bishop sentenced without so much as
being heard to any purpose. This was thought a very
extraordinary way of proceeding, and was universally
resented, and so much the rather for that two Bishops,
Durham and Rochester, sitting in the commission and
giving their suffrages the Archbishop of Canterbury
refused to sit among them. He was only suspended <i>ab
officio</i>, and that was soon after taken off. He was brother
to the Earl of Northampton, had once been a soldier,
had traveled in Italy, but became a sober, grave, and
excellent prelate.</p>
