<p>This year my father was appointed
Sheriff, the last, as I think, who served in that
honorable office for Surrey and Sussex, before they were
disjoined. He had 116 servants in liveries, every one
liveried in green satin doublets; divers gentlemen and
persons of quality waited on him in the same garb and
habit, which at that time (when thirty or forty was the
usual retinue of the High Sheriff) was esteemed a great
matter. Nor was this out of the least vanity that my
father exceeded (who was one of the greatest decliners
of it); but because he could not refuse the civility of
his friends and relations, who voluntarily came themselves,
or sent in their servants. But my father was
afterward most unjustly and spitefully molested by that
jeering judge, Richardson, for reprieving the execution
of a woman, to gratify my Lord of Lindsey, then Admiral:
but out of this he emerged with as much honor
as trouble. The king made this year his progress into
Scotland, and Duke James was born.</p>
