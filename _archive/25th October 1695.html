<p>The Archbishop and myself went
to Hammersmith, to visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was
entirely blind; a very mortifying sight. He showed us
his invention of writing, which was very ingenious; also
his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling;
and other pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps,
etc., and the pump he had erected that serves water to
his garden, and to passengers, with an inscription, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water. He had newly buried Â£200
worth of music books six feet under ground, being, as
he said, love songs and vanity. He plays himself psalms
and religious hymns on the theorbo. Very mild weather
the whole of October.</p>
