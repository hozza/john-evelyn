<p>Came to see me the Earl of Strafford,
Lord Ossory and his brother, Sir John Southcott, Sir
Edward Stawell, two of my Lord Spencer's sons, and Dr.
Stewart, Dean of St. Paul's, a learned and pious man,
where we entertained the time upon several subjects,
especially the affairs of England, and the lamentable
condition of our Church. The Lord Gerrard also called
to see my collection of sieges and battles.</p>
