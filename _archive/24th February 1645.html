<p>We walked to St. Roche's and
Martine's, near the brink of the Tiber, a large hospital
for both sexes. Hence, to the Mausoleum Augusti, between
the Tiber and the Via Flaminia, now much ruined,
which had formerly contended for its sumptuous architecture.
It was intended as a cemetery for the Roman
Emperors, had twelve ports, and was covered with a
cupola of white marble, environed with stately trees and
innumerable statues, all of it now converted into a garden.
We passed the afternoon at the Sapienza, a very
stately building full of good marbles, especially the portico,
of admirable architecture. These are properly the
University Schools, where lectures are read on Law,
Medicine, and Anatomy, and students perform their
exercises.</p>

<p>Hence, we walked to the church of St. Andrea della
Valle, near the former Theater of Pompey, and the
famous Piccolomini, but given to this church and the
Order, who are Theatins. The Barberini have in this
place a chapel, of curious incrusted marbles of several
sorts, and rare paintings. Under it is a place where St.
Sebastian is said to have been beaten with rods before
he was shot with darts. The cupola is painted by Lanfranc,
an inestimable work, and the whole fabric and
monastery adjoining are admirable.</p>
