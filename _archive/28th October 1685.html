<p>At the Royal Society, an urn full
of bones was presented, dug up in a highway, while repairing
it, in a field in Camberwell, in Surrey; it was
found entire with its cover, among many others, believed
to be truly Roman and ancient.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Bulkeley described to us a model of a
chariot he had invented, which it was not possible to
overthrow in whatever uneven way it was drawn, giving
us a wonderful relation of what it had performed in that
kind, for ease, expedition, and safety; there were some
inconveniences yet to be remediedâ€”it would not contain
more than one person; was ready to take fire every ten
miles; and being placed and playing on no fewer than
ten rollers, it made a most prodigious noise, almost intolerable.
A remedy was to be sought for these inconveniences.</p>
