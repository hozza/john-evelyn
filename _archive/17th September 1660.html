<p>Went to London, to see the
splendid entry of the Prince de Ligne, Ambassador extraordinary
from Spain; he was general of the Spanish
King's horse in Flanders, and was accompanied with
divers great persons from thence, and an innumerable
retinue. His train consisted of seventeen coaches, with
six horses of his own, besides a great number of English,
etc. Greater bravery had I never seen. He was
received in the Banqueting House, in exceeding state,
all the great officers of Court attending.</p>

<p>23d September, <a id="tn_png_371"></a><!--TN: "1650" changed to "1660"-->1660. In the midst of all this joy
and jubilee, the Duke of Gloucester died of the smallpox,
in the prime of youth, and a prince of extraordinary
hopes.</p>
