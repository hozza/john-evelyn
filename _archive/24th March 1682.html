<p>I went to see the corpse of that
obstinate creature, Colonel Vrats, the King permitting
that his body should be transported to his own country,
he being of a good family, and one of the first embalmed
by a particular art, invented by one William Russell, a
coffin-maker, which preserved the body without disboweling,
or to appearance using any bituminous matter.
The flesh was florid, soft, and full, as if the person
were only sleeping. He had now been dead near fifteen
days, and lay exposed in a very rich coffin lined
with lead, too magnificent for so daring and horrid a
murderer.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the Royal Society were exhibited
some pieces of amber sent by the Duke of Brandenburg,
in one of which was a spider, in another a gnat, both very
entire. There was a discourse of the tingeing of glass,
especially with red, and the difficulty of finding any red
color effectual to penetrate glass, among the glass-painters;
that the most diaporous, as blue, yellow, etc.,
did not enter into the substance of what was ordinarily
painted, more than very shallow, unless incorporated in
the metal itself, other reds and whites not at all beyond
the superfices.</p>
