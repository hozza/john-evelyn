<p>To London, upon the second
edition of my "Sylva," which I presented to the Royal
Society.</p>

<p>6th February, 1669-70. Dr. John Breton, Master of
Emmanuel College, in Cambridge (uncle to our vicar),
preached on John i. 27; "whose shoe-latchet I am not
worthy to unloose," etc., describing the various fashions
of shoes, or sandals, worn by the Jews, and other nations:
of the ornaments of the feet: how great persons had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
servants that took them off when they came to their
houses, and bore them after them: by which pointing the
dignity of our Savior, when such a person as St. John
Baptist acknowledged his unworthiness even of that mean
office. The lawfulness, decentness, and necessity, of
subordinate degrees and ranks of men and servants, as
well in the Church as State: against the late levelers,
and others of that dangerous rabble, who would have all
alike.</p>
