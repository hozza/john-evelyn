<p>One Tomson, a Jesuit, showed me
such a collection of rarities, sent from the Jesuits of
Japan and China to their Order at Paris, as a present to
be reserved in their repository, but brought to London
by the East India ships for them, as in my life I had
not seen. The chief things were, rhinoceros's horns;
glorious vests, wrought and embroidered on cloth of
gold, but with such lively colors, that for splendor and
vividness we have nothing in Europe that approaches it;
a girdle studded with agates and rubies of great value
and size; knives, of so keen an edge as one could not
touch them, nor was the metal of our color, but more
pale and livid; fans, like those our ladies use, but much
larger, and with long handles curiously carved and
filled with Chinese characters; a sort of paper very broad,
thin, and fine, like abortive parchment, and exquisitely
polished, of an amber yellow, exceedingly glorious and
pretty to look on, and seeming to be like that which my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
Lord Verulam describes in his "<i>Nova Atlantis</i>"; several
other sorts of paper, some written, others printed; prints
of landscapes, their idols, saints, pagods, of most ugly
serpentine monstrous and hideous shapes, to which they
paid devotion; pictures of men and countries, rarely
painted on a sort of gummed calico, transparent as glass;
flowers, trees, beasts, birds, etc., excellently wrought in
a kind of sleeve silk, very natural; divers drugs that our
druggists and physicians could make nothing of, especially
one which the Jesuit called <i>Lac Tigridis</i>: it looked
like a fungus, but was weighty like metal, yet was a
concretion, or coagulation, of some other matter; several
book MSS.; a grammar of the language written in Spanish;
with innumerable other rarities.</p>
