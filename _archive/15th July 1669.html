<p>Having two days before had notice
that the University intended me the honor of Doctorship,
I was this morning attended by the beadles belonging
to the Law, who conducted me to the Theater,
where I found the Duke of Ormond (now Chancellor of
the University) with the Earl of Chesterfield and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Spencer (brother to the late Earl of Sunderland). Thence,
we marched to the Convocation House, a convocation
having been called on purpose; here, being all of us
robed in the porch, in scarlet with caps and hoods, we
were led in by the Professor of Laws, and presented respectively
by name, with a short eulogy, to the Vice-Chancellor,
who sat in the chair, with all the Doctors
and Heads of Houses and masters about the room, which
was exceedingly full. Then, began the Public Orator his
speech, directed chiefly to the Duke of Ormond, the
Chancellor; but in which I had my compliment, in course.
This ended, we were called up, and created Doctors according
to the form, and seated by the Vice-Chancellor
among the Doctors, on his right hand; then, the Vice-Chancellor
made a short speech, and so, saluting our
brother Doctors, the pageantry concluded, and the convocation
was dissolved. So formal a creation of honorary
Doctors had seldom been seen, that a convocation
should be called on purpose, and speeches made by the
Orator; but they could do no less, their Chancellor being
to receive, or rather do them, this honor. I should
have been made Doctor with the rest at the public Act,
but their expectation of their Chancellor made them defer
it. I was then led with my brother Doctors to an
extraordinary entertainment at Doctor Mewes's, head
of St. John's College, and, after abundance of feasting
and compliments, having visited the Vice-Chancellor and
other Doctors, and given them thanks for the honor
done me, I went toward home the 16th, and got as far
as Windsor, and so to my house the next day.</p>
