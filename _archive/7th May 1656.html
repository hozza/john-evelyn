<p>I visited Dr. Taylor, and prevailed on
him to propose Monsieur le Franc to the Bishop that
he might have Orders, I having sometime before brought
him to a full consent to the Church of England, her doctrine
and discipline, in which he had till of late made
some difficulty; so he was this day ordained both deacon
and priest by the Bishop of Meath. I paid the fees to
his lordship, who was very poor and in great want; to
that necessity were our clergy reduced! In the afternoon
I met Alderman Robinson, to treat with Mr.Â Papillion
about the marriage of my cousin, George Tuke, with Mrs.
Fontaine.</p>
