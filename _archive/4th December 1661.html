<p>I had much discourse with the
Duke of York, concerning strange cures he affirmed of
a woman who swallowed a whole ear of barley, which
worked out at her side. I told him of the <span style="font-size:.8em;">KNIFE SWALLOWED</span><a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_69_69">69</a>
