<p>The French King, being now with a
great army of 28,000 men about Dunkirk, divers of the
grandees of that Court, and a vast number of gentlemen
and cadets, in fantastical habits, came flocking over to
see our Court and compliment his Majesty. I was
present, when they first were conducted into the Queen's
withdrawing-room, where saluted their Majesties the
Dukes of Guise, Longueville, and many others of the first
rank.</p>
