<p>Our Vicar preached on 2 Peter ii. 21,
upon the danger of relapsing into sin. After this, I went
and heard M.Â Lamot, an eloquent French preacher at
Greenwich, on Prov. xxx. 8, 9, a consolatory discourse to
the poor and religious refugees who escaped out of France
in the cruel persecution.</p>
