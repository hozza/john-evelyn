<p>Sir William Jones summed up the
evidence; to him succeeded all the rest of the managers,
and then Mr. Henry Poule made a vehement oration.
After this my Lord, as on all occasions, and often during
the trial, spoke in his own defense, denying the charge
altogether, and that he had never seen Oates, or Turberville,
at the time and manner affirmed: in truth, their
testimony did little weigh with me; Dugdale's only
seemed to press hardest, to which my Lord spoke a great
while, but confusedly, without any method.</p>

<p>One thing my Lord said as to Oates, which I confess
did exceedingly affect me: That a person who during his
depositions should so vauntingly brag that though he
went over to the Church of Rome, yet he was never a
Papist, nor of their religion, all the time that he seemed
to apostatize from the Protestant, but only as a spy;
though he confessed he took their sacrament; worshiped
images, went through all their oaths and discipline of
their proselytes, swearing secrecy and to be faithful, but
with intent to come over again and betray them; that
such a hypocrite, that had so deeply prevaricated as
even to turn idolater (for so we of the Church of England
termed it), attesting God so solemnly that he was
entirely theirs and devoted to their interest, and conse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>quently
(as he pretended) trusted; I say, that the witness
of such a profligate wretch should be admitted
against the life of a peer,—this my Lord looked upon as
a monstrous thing, and such as must needs redound to
the dishonor of our religion and nation. And verily I
am of his Lordship's opinion: such a man's testimony
should not be taken against the life of a dog. But the
merit of something material which he discovered against
Coleman, put him in such esteem with the Parliament,
that now, I fancy, he stuck at nothing, and thought everybody
was to take what he said for Gospel. The consideration
of this, and some other circumstances, began to
stagger me; particularly how it was possible that one who
went among the Papists on such a design, and pretended
to be intrusted with so many letters and commissions
from the Pope and the party,—nay, and delivered them to
so many great persons,—should not reserve one of them
to show, nor so much as one copy of any commission,
which he who had such dexterity in opening letters
might certainly have done, to the undeniable conviction
of those whom he accused; but, as I said, he gained
credit on Coleman. But, as to others whom he so madly
flew upon, I am little inclined to believe his testimony,
he being so slight a person, so passionate, ill bred, and of
such impudent behavior; nor is it likely that such piercing
politicians as the Jesuits should trust him with so
high and so dangerous secrets.</p>
