<p>There was now a very gallant horse to be baited to
death with dogs; but he fought them all, so as the fiercest
of them could not fasten on him, till the men run him
through with their swords. This wicked and barbarous
sport deserved to have been punished in the cruel contrivers
to get money, under pretense that the horse had
killed a man, which was false. I would not be persuaded
to be a spectator.</p>
