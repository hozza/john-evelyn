<p>I was elected one of the Comptrollers
of the Middle Temple revellers, as the fashion of
the young students and gentlemen was, the Christmas
being kept this year with great solemnity; but, being
desirous to pass it in the country, I got leave to resign
my staff of office, and went with my brother Richard to
Wotton.</p>
