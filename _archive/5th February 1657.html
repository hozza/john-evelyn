<p>Dined at the Holland Ambassador's;
he told me the East India Company of Holland
had constantly a stock of £400,000 in India, and forty-eight
men-of-war there: he spoke of their exact and just
keeping their books and correspondence, so as no adventurer's
stock could possibly be lost, or defeated; that it
was a vulgar error that the Hollanders furnished their
enemies with powder and ammunition for their money,
though engaged in a cruel war, but that they used to
merchandise <a id="tn_png_349"></a><!--TN: "indiffierently" changed to "indifferently"-->indifferently, and were permitted to sell to
the friends of their enemies. He laughed at our Committee
of Trade, as composed of men wholly ignorant of
it, and how they were the ruin of commerce, by gratifying
some for private ends.</p>

<p>10th <a id="tn_png_349a"></a><!--TN: "January" changed to "February"-->February, 1657. I went to visit the governor of
Havannah, a brave, sober, valiant Spanish gentleman,
taken by Captain Young, of Deptford, when, after twenty
years being in the Indies, and amassing great wealth,
his lady and whole family, except two sons, were burned,
destroyed, and taken within sight of Spain, his eldest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
son, daughter, and wife, perishing with immense treasure.
One son, of about seventeen years old, with his
brother of one year old, were the only ones saved. The
young gentleman, about seventeen, was a well-complexioned
youth, not olive-colored; he spoke Latin handsomely,
was extremely well-bred, and born in the Caraccas,
1,000 miles south of the equinoctial, near the mountains
of Potosi; he had never been in Europe before. The
Governor was an ancient gentleman of great courage, of
the order of St. Jago, sorely wounded in his arm, and his
ribs broken; he lost for his own share £100,000 sterling,
which he seemed to bear with exceeding indifference,
and nothing dejected. After some discourse, I went with
them to Arundel House, where they dined. They were
now going back into Spain, having obtained their liberty
from Cromwell. An example of human vicissitude!</p>

<p>14th <a id="tn_png_350"></a><!--TN: "January" changed to "February"-->February, 1657. To London, where I found Mrs.
Cary; next day came Mr. Mordaunt (since Viscount Mordaunt),
younger son to the Countess of Peterborough, to
see his mistress, bringing with him two of my Lord of
Dover's daughters: so, after dinner, they all departed.</p>
