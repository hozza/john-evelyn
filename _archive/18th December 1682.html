<p>I sold my East India adventure
of £250 principal for £750 to the Royal Society, after I
had been in that company twenty-five years, being extraordinarily
advantageous, by the blessing of God.</p>

<p>23d January, 1682-83. Sir Francis North, son to the
Lord North, and Lord Chief Justice, being made Lord
Keeper on the death of the Earl of Nottingham, the Lord
Chancellor, I went to congratulate him. He is a most
knowing, learned, and ingenious man, and, besides being
an excellent person, of an ingenious and sweet disposition,
very skillful in music, painting, the new philosophy,
and politer studies.</p>
