<p>I dined at Lambeth, making my first
visit to the Archbishop, where there was much company,
and great cheer. After prayers in the evening, my Lord
made me stay to show me his house, furniture, and garden,
which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual
Archbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought
ready furnished by his predecessor. We discoursed of
several public matters, particularly of the Princess of
Denmark, who made so little figure.</p>
