<p>Thursday. I represented to his
Majesty the case of the French prisoners at war in my
custody, and besought him that there might be still the
same care of watching at all places contiguous to unseized
houses. It is not indeed imaginable how extraordinary
the vigilance and activity of the King and the Duke was,
even laboring in person, and being present to command,
order, reward, or encourage workmen; by which he showed
his affection to his people, and gained theirs. Having,
then, disposed of some under cure at the Savoy, I returned
to Whitehall, where I dined at Mr. Offley's, the groom-porter,
who was my relation.</p>
