<p>News of the Prince of Orange
having accused the Deputies of Amsterdam of <i>crimen
læsæ Majestatis</i>, and being pensioners to France.</p>

<p>Dr. Tenison communicated to me his intention of erecting
a library in St. Martin's parish, for the public use,
and desired my assistance, with Sir Christopher Wren,
about the placing and structure thereof, a worthy and
laudable design. He told me there were thirty or forty
young men in Orders in his parish, either governors to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
young gentlemen or chaplains to noblemen, who being
reproved by him on occasion for frequenting taverns or
coffeehouses, told him they would study or employ their
time better, if they had books. This put the pious Doctor
on this design; and indeed a great reproach it is that
so great a city as London should not have a public library
becoming it. There ought to be one at St. Paul's; the
west end of that church (if ever finished) would be a
convenient place.</p>
