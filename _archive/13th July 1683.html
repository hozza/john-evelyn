<p>As I was visiting Sir Thomas Yarborough
and his Lady, in Covent Garden, the astonishing news
was brought to us of the Earl of Essex having cut
his throat, having been but three days a prisoner in the
Tower, and this happened on the very day and instant
that Lord Russell was on his trial, and had sentence of
death. This accident exceedingly amazed me, my Lord
Essex being so well known by me to be a person of such
sober and religious deportment, so well at his ease, and
so much obliged to the King. It is certain the King and
Duke were at the Tower, and passed by his window about
the same time this morning, when my Lord asking for a
razor, shut himself into a closet, and perpetrated the horrid
act. Yet it was wondered by some how it was possible
he should do it in the manner he was found, for
the wound was so deep and wide, that being cut through
the gullet, windpipe, and both the jugulars, it reached
to the very vertebr√¶ of the neck, so that the head held
to it by a very little skin as it were; the gapping too of
the razor, and cutting his own fingers, was a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
strange; but more, that having passed the jugulars he
should have strength to proceed so far, that an executioner
could hardly have done more with an ax. There
were odd reflections upon it.</p>

<p>The fatal news coming to Hicks's Hall upon the article
of my Lord Russell's trial, was said to have had no little
influence on the Jury and all the Bench to his prejudice.
Others said that he had himself on some occasions hinted
that in case he should be in danger of having his life
taken from him by any public misfortune, those who
thirsted for his estate should miss of their aim; and that
he should speak favorably of that Earl of Northumberland,<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_51_51">51</a>
and some others, who made away with themselves;
but these are discourses so unlike his sober and prudent
conversation that I have no inclination to credit them.
What might instigate him to this devilish act, I am not
able to conjecture. My Lord Clarendon, his brother-in-law,
who was with him but the day before, assured me he was
then very cheerful, and declared it to be the effect of his
innocence and loyalty; and most believe that his Majesty
had no severe intentions against him, though he was altogether
inexorable as to Lord Russell and some of the rest.
For my part, I believe the crafty and ambitious Earl of
Shaftesbury had brought them into some dislike of the
present carriage of matters at Court, not with any design
of destroying the monarchy (which Shaftesbury had in
confidence and for unanswerable reasons told me he
would support to his last breath, as having seen and felt
the misery of being under mechanic tyranny), but perhaps
of setting up some other whom he might govern, and
frame to his own platonic fancy, without much regard to
the religion established under the hierarchy, for which he
had no esteem; but when he perceived those whom he
had engaged to rise, fail of his expectations, and the day
past, reproaching his accomplices that a second day for
an exploit of this nature was never successful, he gave
them the slip, and got into Holland, where the fox died,
three months before these unhappy Lords and others were
discovered or suspected. Every one deplored Essex and
Russell, especially the last, as being thought to have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
drawn in on pretense only of endeavoring to rescue
the King from his present councilors, and secure religion
from Popery, and the nation from arbitrary government,
now so much apprehended; while the rest of those who
were fled, especially Ferguson and his gang, had doubtless
some bloody design to get up a Commonwealth, and turn
all things topsy-turvy. Of the same tragical principles
is Sydney.</p>

<p>I had this day much discourse with Monsieur Pontaq,
son to the famous and wise prime President of Bordeaux.
This gentleman was owner of that excellent <i>vignoble</i>
of Pontaq and O'Brien, from whence come the
choicest of our Bordeaux wines; and I think I may truly
say of him, what was not so truly said of St. Paul, that
much learning had made him mad. He had studied well
in philosophy, but chiefly the Rabbins, and was exceedingly
addicted to cabalistical fancies, an eternal hablador
[romancer], and half distracted by reading abundance
of the extravagant Eastern Jews. He spoke all languages,
was very rich, had a handsome person, and was
well bred, about forty-five years of age.</p>
