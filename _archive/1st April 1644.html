<p>I went to see more exactly the rooms
of the fine Palace of Luxemburg, in the Fauxbourg St.
Germains, built by Mary di Medicis, and I think one of
the most noble, entire, and finished piles that is to be
seen, taking it with the garden and all its accomplishments.
The gallery is of the painting of Rubens, being
the history of the Foundress's Life, rarely designed; at
the end of it is the Duke of Orleans' library, well furnished
with excellent books, all bound in maroquin and
gilded, the valance of the shelves being of green velvet,
fringed with gold. In the cabinet joining to it are only
the smaller volumes, with six cabinets of medals, and an
excellent collection of shells and agates, whereof some
are prodigiously rich. This Duke being very learned in
medals and plants, nothing of that kind escapes him.
There are other spacious, noble, and princely furnished
rooms, which look toward the gardens, which are nothing
inferior to the rest.</p>

<p>The court below is formed into a square by a corridor,
having over the chief entrance a stately cupola, covered
with stone: the rest is cloistered and arched on pilasters
of rustic work. The terrace ascending before the front,
paved with white and black marble, is balustered with
white marble, exquisitely polished.</p>

<p>Only the hall below is low, and the staircase somewhat
of a heavy design, but the facia toward the parterre
which is also arched and vaulted with stone, is of admirable
beauty and full of sculpture.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The gardens are near an English mile in compass,
inclosed with a stately wall, and in a good air. The
parterre is indeed of box, but so rarely designed and
accurately kept cut, that the embroidery makes a wonderful
effect to the lodgings which front it. 'Tis divided
into four squares and as many circular knots, having in
the center a noble basin of marble near thirty feet in
diameter (as I remember), in which a Triton of brass
holds a dolphin, that casts a girandola of water near
thirty feet high, playing perpetually, the water being conveyed
from Arceuil by an aqueduct of stone, built after
the old Roman magnificence. About this ample parterre,
the spacious walks and all included, runs a border of
freestone, adorned with pedestals for pots and statues,
and part of it near the steps of the terrace, with a rail
and baluster of pure white marble.</p>

<p>The walks are exactly fair, long, and variously descending
and so justly planted with limes, elms, and other
trees, that nothing can be more delicious, especially that
of the hornbeam hedge, which being high and stately,
buts full on the fountain.</p>

<p>Toward the further end, is an excavation intended for
a vast fish-pool, but never finished, and near it is an
inclosure for a garden of simples, well kept; and here
the Duke keeps tortoises in great number, who use the
pool of water on one side of the garden. Here is also a
conservatory for snow. At the upper part, toward the
palace, is a grove of tall elms cut into a star, every ray
being a walk, whose center is a large fountain.</p>

<p>The rest of the ground is made into several inclosures
(all hedge-work or rows of trees) of whole fields, meadows,
bocages, some of them containing divers acres.</p>

<p>Next the street side, and more contiguous to the house,
are knots in trail, or grass work, where likewise runs a
fountain. Toward the grotto and stables, within a wall,
is a garden of choice flowers, in which the duke spends
many thousand pistoles. In sum, nothing is wanted to
render this palace and gardens perfectly beautiful and
magnificent; nor is it one of the least diversions to see
the number of persons of quality, citizens and strangers,
who frequent it, and to whom all access is freely permitted,
so that you shall see some walks and retirements full of
gallants and ladies; in others melancholy friars; in others,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
studious scholars; in others, jolly citizens, some sitting or
lying on the grass, others running and jumping; some
playing at bowls and ball, others dancing and singing; and
all this without the least disturbance, by reason of the
largeness of the place.</p>

<p>What is most admirable, you see no gardeners, or men
at work, and yet all is kept in such exquisite order, as if
they did nothing else but work; it is so early in the
morning, that all is dispatched and done without the least
confusion.</p>

<p>I have been the larger in the description of this paradise,
for the extraordinary delight I have taken in those
sweet retirements. The Cabinet and Chapel nearer
the garden-front have some choice pictures. All the
houses near this are also very noble palaces, especially
Petite Luxemburg. The ascent of the street is handsome
from its breadth, situation, and buildings.</p>

<p>I went next to view Paris from the top of St. Jacques'
steeple, esteemed the highest in the town, from whence
I had a full view of the whole city and suburbs, both
which, as I judge, are not so large as London: though
the dissimilitude of their several forms and situations,
this being round, London long,â€”renders it difficult to
determine; but there is no comparison between the buildings,
palaces, and materials, this being entirely of stone
and more sumptuous, though I esteem our piazzas to exceed
theirs.</p>

<p>Hence I took a turn in St. Innocent's churchyard,
where the story of the devouring quality of the ground
(consuming bodies in twenty-four hours), the vast charnels
of bones, tombs, pyramids, and sepulchers, took up
much of my time, together with the hieroglyphical characters
of Nicholas Flamel's philosophical work, who had
founded this church, and divers other charitable establishments,
as he testifies in his book.</p>

<p>Here divers clerks get their livelihood by inditing letters
for poor maids and other ignorant people who come
to them for advice, and to write for them into the country,
both to their sweethearts, parents, and friends;
every large gravestone serving for a table. Joining to
this church is a common fountain, with good relievos
upon it.</p>

<p>The next day I was carried to see a French gentle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>man's
curious collection, which abounded in fair and rich
jewels of all sorts of precious stones, most of them of
great sizes and value; agates and onyxes, some of them
admirably colored and antique; nor inferior were his
landscapes from the best hands, most of which he had
caused to be copied in miniature; one of which, rarely
painted on stone, was broken by one of our company, by
the mischance of setting it up: but such was the temper
and civility of the gentleman, that it altered nothing of
his free and noble humor.</p>

<p>The next morning, I was had by a friend to the garden
of Monsieur Morine, who, from being an ordinary
gardener, is become one of the most skillful and curious
persons in France for his rare collection of shells, flowers,
and insects.</p>

<p>His garden is of an exact oval figure, planted with cypress,
cut flat and set as even as a wall: the tulips, anemones,
ranunculuses, crocuses, etc., are held to be of
the rarest, and draw all the admirers of that kind to his
house during the season. He lived in a kind of hermitage
at one side of his garden, where his collection of
porcelain and coral, whereof one is carved into a large
crucifix, is much esteemed. He has also books of prints,
by Albert [Durer], Van Leyden, Callot, etc. His collection
of all sorts of insects, especially of butterflies, is
most curious; these he spreads and so medicates, that no
corruption invading them, he keeps them in drawers, so
placed as to represent a beautiful piece of tapestry.</p>

<p>He showed me the remarks he had made on their propagation,
which he promised to publish. Some of these,
as also of his best flowers, he had caused to be painted
in miniature by rare hands, and some in oil.</p>
