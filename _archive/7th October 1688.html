<p>Dr. Tenison preached at St. Martin's
on 2 Tim. iii. 16, showing the Scriptures to be our
only rule of faith, and its perfection above all traditions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
After which, near 1,000 devout persons partook of the
Communion. The sermon was chiefly occasioned by a
Jesuit, who in the Masshouse on the Sunday before had
disparaged the Scripture and railed at our translation,
which some present contradicting, they pulled him out
of the pulpit, and treated him very coarsely, insomuch
that it was like to create a great disturbance in the city.</p>

<p>Hourly expectation of the Prince of Orange's invasion
heightened to that degree, that his Majesty thought fit
to abrogate the Commission for the dispensing Power
(but retaining his own right still to dispense with all
laws) and restore the ejected Fellows of Magdalen College,
Oxford. In the meantime, he called over 5,000
Irish, and 4,000 Scots, and continued to remove Protestants
and put in Papists at Portsmouth and other places
of trust, and retained the Jesuits about him, increasing
the universal discontent. It brought people to so desperate
a pass, that they seemed passionately to long for
and desire the landing of that Prince, whom they looked
on to be their deliverer from Popish tyranny, praying
incessantly for an east wind, which was said to be the
only hindrance of his expedition with a numerous army
ready to make a descent. To such a strange temper,
and unheard of in former times, was this poor nation reduced,
and of which I was an eyewitness. The apprehension
was (and with reason) that his Majesty's forces
would neither at land nor sea oppose them with that
vigor requisite to repel invaders.</p>

<p>The late imprisoned Bishops were now called to reconcile
matters, and the Jesuits hard at work to foment confusion
among the Protestants by their usual tricks. A letter
was sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury,<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_71_71">71</a> informing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
him, from good hands, of what was contriving by them.
A paper of what the Bishops advised his Majesty was
published. The Bishops were enjoined to prepare a form
of prayer against the feared invasion. A pardon published.
Soldiers and mariners daily pressed.</p>
