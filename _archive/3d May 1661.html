<p>I went to see the wonderful engine for
weaving silk stockings, said to have been the invention
of an Oxford scholar forty years since; and I returned
by Fromantil's, the famous clockmaker, to see some pendules,
Monsieur Zulichem being with us.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>This evening, I was with my Lord Brouncker, Sir
Robert Murray, Sir Patrick Neill, Monsieur Zulichem,
and Bull (all of them of our Society, and excellent mathematicians),
to show his Majesty, who was present, Saturn's
annulus, as some thought, but as Zulichem affirmed
with his <i>balteus</i> (as that learned gentleman had published),
very near eclipsed by the moon, near the Mons Porphyritis;
also, Jupiter and satellites, through his Majesty's
great telescope, drawing thirty-five feet; on which were
divers discourses.</p>
