<p>Being the day appointed for
my Lord Ambassador to set out, I met them with my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
coach at New Cross. There were with him my Lady
his wife, and my dear friend, Mrs. Godolphin, who,
out of an extraordinary friendship, would needs accompany
my lady to Paris, and stay with her some time,
which was the chief inducement for permitting my son
to travel, but I knew him safe under her inspection, and
in regard my Lord himself had promised to take him
into his special favor, he having intrusted all he had to
my care.</p>

<p>Thus we set out three coaches (besides mine), three
wagons, and about forty horses. It being late, and my
Lord as yet but valetudinary, we got but to Dartford,
the first day, the next to Sittingbourne.</p>

<p>At Rochester, the major, Mr. Cony, then an officer of
mine for the sick and wounded of that place, gave the
ladies a handsome refreshment as we came by his house.</p>
