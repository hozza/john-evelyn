<p>I returned to London, where I found
the Commissioners of the Admiralty abolished, and the
office of Admiral restored to the Duke, as to the disposing
and ordering all sea business; but his Majesty signed
all petitions, papers, warrants, and commissions, that the
Duke, not acting as admiral by commission or office,
might not incur the penalty of the late Act against Papists
and Dissenters holding offices, and refusing the oath
and test. Every one was glad of this change, those in
the late Commission being utterly ignorant in their duty,
to the great damage of the Navy.</p>

<p>The utter ruin of the Low Country was threatened by
the siege of Luxemburg, if not timely relieved, and by
the obstinacy of the Hollanders, who refused to assist the
Prince of Orange, being corrupted by the French.</p>
