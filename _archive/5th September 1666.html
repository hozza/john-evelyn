<p>It crossed toward Whitehall;
but oh! the confusion there was then at that Court! It
pleased his Majesty to command me, among the rest, to
look after the quenching of Fetter-lane end, to preserve (if
possible) that part of Holborn, while the rest of the
gentlemen took their several posts, some at one part, and
some at another (for now they began to bestir themselves,
and not till now, who hitherto had stood as men intoxicated,
with their hands across), and began to consider
that nothing was likely to put a stop but the blowing up
of so many houses as might make a wider gap than any
had yet been made by the ordinary method of pulling
them down with engines. This some stout seamen proposed
early enough to have saved near the whole city,
but this some tenacious and avaricious men, aldermen,
etc., would not permit, because their houses must have
been of the first. It was, therefore, now commended to
be practiced; and my concern being particularly for the
Hospital of St. Bartholomew, near Smithfield, where I had
many wounded and sick men, made me the more diligent
to promote it; nor was my care for the Savoy less. It
now pleased God, by abating the wind, and by the
industry of the people, when almost all was lost infusing
a new spirit into them, that the fury of it began sensibly
to abate about noon, so as it came no farther than the
Temple westward, nor than the entrance of Smithfield,
north: but continued all this day and night so impetuous
toward Cripplegate and the Tower, as made us all despair.
It also broke out again in the temple; but the
courage of the multitude persisting, and many houses
being blown up, such gaps and desolations were soon made,
as, with the former three days' consumption, the back fire
did not so vehemently urge upon the rest as formerly.
There was yet no standing near the burning and glowing
ruins by near a furlong's space.</p>

<p>The coal and wood wharfs, and magazines of oil, rosin,
etc., did infinite mischief, so as the invective which a little
before I had dedicated to his Majesty and published,<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5_5">5</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
giving warning what probably might be the issue of suffering
those shops to be in the city was looked upon as
a prophecy.</p>

<p>The poor inhabitants were dispersed about St. George's
Fields, and Moorfields, as far as Highgate, and several
miles in circle, some under tents, some under miserable
huts and hovels, many without a rag, or any necessary
utensils, bed or board, who from delicateness, riches, and
easy accommodations in stately and well-furnished houses,
were now reduced to extreme misery and poverty.</p>

<p>In this calamitous condition, I returned with a sad heart
to my house, blessing and adoring the distinguishing mercy
of God to me and mine, who, in the midst of all this ruin,
was like Lot, in my little Zoar, safe and sound.</p>
