<p>With a gentleman of the Rhyngraves,
I went in a cart, or tumbrel (for it was no better; no
other accommodation could be procured), of two wheels
and one horse, to Bergen-op-Zoom, meeting by the way
divers parties of his Highness's army now retiring toward
their winter quarters; the convoy skiffs riding by
thousands along the harbor. The fort was heretofore
built by the English.</p>

<p>The next morning I embarked for Lillo, having refused
a convoy of horse which was offered me. The tide being
against us, we landed short of the fort on the beach,
where we marched half leg deep in mud, ere we could
gain the dyke, which, being five or six miles from Lillo,
we were forced to walk on foot very wet and discomposed;
and then entering a boat we passed the ferry, and came
to the castle. Being taken before the Governor, he demanded
my pass, to which he set his hand, and asked two
rix-dollars for a fee, which methought appeared very exorbitant
in a soldier of his quality. I told him that I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
already purchased my pass of the commissaries at Rotterdam;
at which, in a great fury, snatching the paper out
of my hand, he flung it scornfully under the table, and
bade me try whether I could get to Antwerp without his
permission: but I had no sooner given him the dollars,
then he returned the passport surlily enough, and made me
pay fourteen Dutch shillings to the cantone, or searcher,
for my contempt, which I was glad to do for fear of
further trouble, should he have discovered my Spanish
pass, in which the States were therein treated by the
name of rebels. Besides all these exactions, I gave the
commissary six shillings, to the soldiers something, and,
ere perfectly clear of this frontier, thirty-one stivers to
the man-of-war, who lay blocking up the river between
Lillo and the opposite sconce called Lifkinshoeck.</p>
