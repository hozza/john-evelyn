<p>The next morning, setting out
early, we arrived soon enough at Winchester to wait on
the King, who was lodged at the Dean's (Dr. Meggot).
I found very few with him besides my Lords Feversham,
Arran, Newport, and the Bishop of Bath and
Wells. His Majesty was discoursing with the bishops
concerning miracles, and what strange things the Saludadors<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_61_61">61</a>
would do in Spain, as by creeping into heated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
ovens without hurt, and that they had a black cross in
the roof of their mouths, but yet were commonly notorious
and profane wretches; upon which his Majesty further
said, that he was so extremely difficult of miracles,
for fear of being imposed upon, that if he should chance
to see one himself, without some other witness, he should
apprehend it a delusion of his senses. Then they spoke
of the boy who was pretended to have a wanting leg
restored him, so confidently asserted by Fr. de Santa
Clara and others. To all of which the Bishop added a
great miracle happening in Winchester to his certain
knowledge, of a poor, miserably sick and decrepit child
(as I remember long kept unbaptized) who immediately
on his baptism, recovered; as also of the salutary effect
of King Charles his Majesty's father's blood, in healing
one that was blind.</p>

<p>There was something said of the second sight happening
to some persons, especially Scotch; upon which his
Majesty, and I think Lord Arran, told us that Monsieur
... a French nobleman, lately here in England, seeing
the late Duke of Monmouth come into the playhouse
at London, suddenly cried out to somebody sitting in the
same box, "<i>Voilà Monsieur comme il entre sans tete!</i>"
Afterward his Majesty spoke of some relics that had effected
strange cures, particularly a piece of our blessed
Savior's cross, that healed a gentleman's rotten nose by
only touching. And speaking of the golden cross and
chain taken out of the coffin of St. Edward the Confessor
at Westminster, by one of the singing-men, who, as the
scaffolds were taken down after his Majesty's coronation,
espying a hole in the tomb, and something glisten, put
his hand in, and brought it to the dean, and he to the
King; his Majesty began to put the Bishop in mind how
earnestly the late King (his brother) called upon him
during his agony, to take out what he had in his pocket.
"I had thought," said the King, "it had been for some keys,
which might lead to some cabinet that his Majesty would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
have me secure"; <a id="tn_png_234"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "but, says he,"-->but,
says he, "you will remember that I
found nothing in any of his pockets but a cross of gold, and a
few insignificant papers"; and thereupon he showed us the
cross, and was pleased to put it into my hand. It was
of gold, about three inches long, having on one side a
crucifix enameled and embossed, the rest was graved
and garnished with goldsmiths' work, and two pretty
broad table amethysts (as I conceived), and at the bottom
a pendant pearl; within was enchased a little fragment,
as was thought, of the true cross, and a Latin inscription
in gold and Roman letters. More company coming
in, this discourse ended. I may not forget a resolution
which his Majesty made, and had a little before entered
upon it at the Council Board at Windsor or Whitehall,
that the negroes in the plantations should all be baptized,
exceedingly declaiming against that impiety of
their masters prohibiting it, out of a mistaken opinion
that they would be <i>ipso facto</i> free; but his Majesty persists
in his resolution to have them christened, which
piety the Bishop blessed him for.</p>

<p>I went out to see the new palace the late King had
begun, and brought almost to the covering. It is placed
on the side of the hill, where formerly stood the old
castle. It is a stately fabric, of three sides and a corridor,
all built of brick, and cornished, windows and columns
at the break and entrance of free-stone. It was
intended for a hunting-house when his Majesty should
come to these parts, and has an incomparable prospect.
I believe there had already been £20,000 and more expended;
but his now Majesty did not seem to encourage
the finishing it at least for a while.</p>

<p>Hence to see the Cathedral, a reverend pile, and in
good repair. There are still the coffins of the six Saxon
Kings, whose bones had been scattered by the sacrilegious
rebels of 1641, in expectation, I suppose, of
finding some valuable relics, and afterward gathered up
again and put into new chests, which stand above the
stalls of the choir.</p>
