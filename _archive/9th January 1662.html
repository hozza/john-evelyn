<p>I saw acted "The Third Part of
the Siege of Rhodes." In this acted the fair and famous
comedian called Roxalana from the part she performed;

of Oxford's <span class="smcap">Miss</span> (as at this time they began to call lewd
women). It was in recitative music.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>
