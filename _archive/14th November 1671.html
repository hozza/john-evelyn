<p>To Council, where Sir Charles
Wheeler, late Governor of the Leeward Islands, having
been complained of for many indiscreet managements, it
was resolved, on scanning many of the particulars, to
advise his Majesty to remove him; and consult what was
to be done, to prevent these inconveniences he had brought
things to. This business staid me in London almost a
week, being in Council, or Committee, every morning
till the 25th.</p>
