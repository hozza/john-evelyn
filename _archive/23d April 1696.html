<p>I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.
Godolphin, the provost. The schoolmaster assured me
there had not been for twenty years a more pregnant
youth in that place than my grandson. I went to see the
King's House at Kensington. It is very noble, though
not great. The gallery furnished with the best pictures
[from] all the houses, of Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein,
Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke, Tintoretto, and
others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty private
library. The gardens about it very delicious.</p>
