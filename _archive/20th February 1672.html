<p>Dr. Parr, of Camberwell, preached
a most pathetic funeral discourse and panegyric at the
interment of our late pastor, Dr. Breton (who died on the
18th), on "Happy is the servant whom, when his Lord
cometh," etc. This good man, among other expressions,
professed that he had never been so touched and concerned
at any loss as at this, unless at that of King
Charles our martyr, and Archbishop Usher, whose chaplain
he had been. Dr. Breton had preached on the 28th
and 30th of January: on the Friday, having fasted all
day, making his provisionary sermon for the Sunday following,
he went well to bed; but was taken suddenly ill
and expired before help could come to him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Never had a parish a greater loss, not only as he was
an excellent preacher, and fitted for our great and vulgar
auditory, but for his excellent life and charity, his meekness
and obliging nature, industrious, helpful, and full of
good works. He left near Â£400 to the poor in his will,
and that what children of his should die in their minority,
their portion should be so employed, I lost in particular
a special friend, and one that had an extraordinary
love for me and mine.</p>
