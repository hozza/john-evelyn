<p>I dined with Pepys, where was Captain
Dampier,<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_85_85">85</a> who had been a famous buccaneer, had
brought hither the painted Prince Job, and printed a relation
of his very strange adventure, and his observations.
He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons. He seemed a
more modest man than one would imagine by the relation
of the crew he had assorted with. He brought a map of
his observations of the course of the winds in the South
Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were
all false as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the
south of the line, that on the north end running by the
coast of Peru being extremely tempestuous.</p>
