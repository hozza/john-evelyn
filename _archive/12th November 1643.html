<p>After dinner we took horse
with the Messagere, hoping to have arrived at Boulogne
that night; but there fell so great a snow, accompanied
with hail, rain, and sudden darkness, that we had much
ado to gain the next village; and in this passage, being
to cross a valley by a causeway, and a bridge built over
a small river, the rain that had fallen making it an impetuous
stream for near a quarter of a mile, my horse
slipping had almost been the occasion of my perishing.
We none of us went to bed; for the soldiers in those
parts leaving little in the villages, we had enough to do
to get ourselves dry, by morning, between the fire and
the fresh straw. The next day early, we arrived at Boulogne.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a double town, one part of it situate on a high
rock, or downs; the other, called the lower town, is yet
with a great declivity toward the sea; both of them defended
by a strong castle, which stands on a notable
eminence. Under the town runs the river, which is yet
but an inconsiderable brook. Henry VIII., in the siege of
this place is said to have used those great leathern guns
which I have since beheld in the Tower of London, inscribed,
"<i>Non Marte opus est cui non deficit Mercurius</i>";
if at least the history be true, which my Lord Herbert
doubts.</p>

<p>The next morning, in some danger of parties [Spanish]
surprising us, we came to Montreuil, built on the summit
of a most conspicuous hill, environed with fair and
ample meadows; but all the suburbs had been from time
to time ruined, and were now lately burnt by the Spanish
inroads. This town is fortified with two very deep
dry ditches; the walls about the bastions and citadel are
a noble piece of masonry. The church is more glorious
without than within; the market place large; but the
inhabitants are miserably poor. The next day, we came
to Abbeville, having passed all this way in continual expectation
of the volunteers, as they call them. This
town affords a good aspect toward the hill from whence
we descended: nor does it deceive us; for it is handsomely
built, and has many pleasant and useful streams
passing through it, the main river being the Somme,
which discharges itself into the sea at St. Valery, almost
in view of the town. The principal church is a
very handsome piece of Gothic architecture, and the
ports and ramparts sweetly planted for defense and ornament.
In the morning, they brought us choice of
guns and pistols to sell at reasonable rates, and
neatly made, being here a merchandise of great account,
the town abounding in gunsmiths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ST. DENIS</div>



<p>Hence we advanced to Beauvais, another town of good
note, and having the first vineyards we had seen. The
next day to Beaumont, and the morrow to Paris, having
taken our repast at St. Denis, two leagues from that great
city. St. Denis is considerable only for its stately cathedral,
and the dormitory of the French kings, there inhumed
as ours at Westminster Abbey. The treasury is esteemed
one of the richest in Europe. The church was built by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
King Dagobert,<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15_15">15</a> but since much enlarged, being now 390
feet long, 100 in breadth, and 80 in height, without comprehending
the cover: it has also a very high shaft of
stone, and the gates are of brass. Here, while the monks
conducted us, we were showed the ancient and modern
sepulchers of their kings, beginning with the founder to
Louis his son, with Charles Martel and Pepin, son and
father of Charlemagne. These lie in the choir, and without
it are many more: among the rest that of Bertrand du
Guesclin, Constable of France; in the chapel of Charles V.,
all his posterity; and near him the magnificent sepulcher
of Francis I., with his children, wars, victories, and triumphs
engraven in marble. In the nave of the church lies the
catafalque, or hearse, of Louis XIII., Henry II., a noble
tomb of Francis II., and Charles IX. Above are bodies of
several Saints; below, under a state of black velvet, the
late Louis XIII., father of this present monarch. Every
one of the ten chapels, or oratories, had some Saints in
them; among the rest, one of the Holy Innocents. The
treasury is kept in the sacristy above, in which are crosses
of massy gold and silver, studded with precious stones, one
of gold three feet high, set with sapphires, rubies, and great
oriental pearls. Another given by Charles the Great,
having a noble amethyst in the middle of it, stones and
pearls of inestimable value. Among the still more valuable
relics are, a nail from our Savior's Cross, in a box of
gold full of precious stones; a crucifix of the true wood of
the Cross, carved by Pope Clement III., enchased in a
crystal covered with gold; a box in which is some of the
Virgin's hair; some of the linen in which our blessed
Savior was wrapped at his nativity; in a huge reliquary,
modeled like a church, some of our Savior's blood, hair,
clothes, linen with which he wiped the Apostles' feet; with
many other equally authentic toys, which the friar who
conducted us would have us believe were authentic relics.
Among the treasures is the crown of Charlemagne, his
seven-foot high scepter and hand of justice, the agraffe of
his royal mantle, beset with diamonds and rubies, his
sword, belt, and spurs of gold; the crown of St. Louis,
covered with precious stones, among which is one vast ruby,
uncut, of inestimable value, weighing 300 carats (under
which is set one of the thorns of our blessed Savior's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
crown), his sword, seal, and hand of justice. The two
crowns of Henry IV., his scepter, hand of justice, and
spurs. The two crowns of his son Louis. In the cloak-royal
of Anne of Bretagne is a very great and rare ruby.
Divers books covered with solid plates of gold, and
studded with precious stones. Two vases of beryl, two
of agate, whereof one is esteemed for its bigness, color,
and embossed carving, the best now to be seen: by a
special favor I was permitted to take the measure and
dimensions of it; the story is a Bacchanalia and sacrifice
to Priapus; a very holy thing truly, and fit for a cloister!
It is really antique, and the noblest jewel there. There
is also a large gondola of chrysolite, a huge urn of porphyry,
another of calcedon, a vase of onyx, the largest I
had ever seen of that stone; two of crystal; a morsel of
one of the waterpots in which our Savior did his first
miracle; the effigies of the Queen of Saba, of Julius,
Augustus, Mark Antony, Cleopatra, and others, upon
sapphires, topazes, agates, and cornelians: that of the
queen of Saba<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16_16">16</a> has a Moorish face; those of Julius and
Nero on agates are rarely colored and cut. A cup in
which Solomon was used to drink, and an Apollo on a
great amethyst. There lay in a window a mirror of a
kind of stone said to have belonged to the poet Virgil.
Charlemagne's chessmen, full of Arabic characters. In
the press next the door, the brass lantern full of crystals,
said to have conducted Judas and his company to apprehend
our blessed Savior. A fair unicorn's horn, sent by
a king of Persia, about seven feet long. In another
press (over which stands the picture in oil of their
Orleans Amazon with her sword), the effigies of the late
French kings in wax, like ours in Westminster, covered
with their robes; with a world of other rarities.
<span class="sidenote">PARIS</span>
Having
rewarded our courteous friar, we took horse for Paris,
where we arrived about five in the afternoon. In the
way were fair crosses of stone carved with fleur-de-lis at
every furlong's end, where they affirm St. Denis rested
and laid down his head after martyrdom, carrying it
from the place where this monastery is builded. We lay
at Paris at the Ville de Venice; where, after I had something
refreshed, I went to visit Sir Richard Browne, his
Majesty's Resident with the French king.</p>
