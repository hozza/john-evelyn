<p>Came the news of my dear grandson
(the only male of my family now remaining) being
fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford, which after the dire
effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted me; but so
it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at
his first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.
Mander (Head of the college and now Vice Chancellor),
who caused him to be brought and lodged in his own
bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his
recovery, to our infinite comfort. We had a letter every
day either from the Vice Chancellor himself, or his tutor.</p>
