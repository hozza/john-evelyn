old was carried about by his parents to show, who had

affirming that he was so born. It did not prejudice his
sight, and he seemed to be a lively playing boy. Every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>body
went to see him; physicians and philosophers examined
it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.</p>
