<p>Dined at Sir Gabriel Sylvius's and
thence to visit the Duke of Norfolk, to ask whether he
would part with any of his cartoons and other drawings
of Raphael, and the great masters; he told me if he
might sell them all together he would, but that the late
Sir Peter Lely (our famous painter) had gotten some of
his best. The person who desired me to treat for them
was Vander Douse, grandson to that great scholar, contemporary
and friend of Joseph Scaliger.</p>
