<p>I dined at Lord Newport's, who
had some excellent pictures, especially that of Sir Thomas
Hanmer, by Vandyke, one of the best he ever painted;
another of our English Dobson's painting; but, above
all, Christ in the Virgin's lap, by Poussin, an admirable
piece; with something of most other famous hands.</p>
