<p>I returned to Tunbridge, and again
drank the water, till 10th of July.</p>

<p>We went to see the house of my Lord Clanrickarde
at Summer hill, near Tunbridge (now given to that
villain, Bradshawe, who condemned the King). 'Tis
situated on an eminent hill, with a park; but has nothing
else extraordinary.</p>
