<p>At the Greek Church, we saw the
Eastern ceremonies performed by a Bishop, etc., in that
tongue. Here the unfortunate Duke and Duchess of
Bouillon received their ashes, it being the first day of
Lent. There was now as much trudging up and down
of devotees, as the day before of licentious people; all
saints alike to appearance.</p>

<p>The gardens of Justinian, which we next visited, are
very full of statues and antiquities, especially urns; among
which is that of Minutius Felix; a terminus that formerly
stood in the Appian way, and a huge colossé of the Emperor
Justinian. There is a delicate aviary on the hill;
the whole gardens furnished with rare collections, fresh,
shady, and adorned with noble fountains. Continuing
our walk a mile farther, we came to Pons Milvius, now
Mela, where Constantine overthrew Maxentius, and saw
the miraculous sign of the cross, <i>In hoc signo vinces</i>. It
was a sweet morning, and the bushes were full of nightingales.
Hence, to Aqua Claudia again, an aqueduct finished
by that Emperor at the expense of eight millions.
In the afternoon, to Farnese's gardens, near the Campo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Vaccino; and upon the Palatine Mount to survey the
ruins of Juno's Temple, in the Piscina, a piazza so-called
near the famous bridge built by Antoninus Pius, and re-edified
by Pope Sextus IV.</p>

<p>The rest of this week, we went to the Vatican, to hear
the sermons, at St. Peter's, of the most famous preachers,
who discourse on the same subjects and text yearly,
full of Italian eloquence and action. On our Lady day,
25th March, we saw the Pope and Cardinals ride in pomp
to the Minerva, the great guns of the Castle of St. Angelo
being fired, when he gives portions to 500 <i>zitelle</i>
(young women), who kiss his feet in procession, some
destined to marry, some to be nuns;—the scholars of the
college celebrating the blessed Virgin with their compositions.
The next day, his Holiness was busied in blessing
golden roses, to be sent to several great Princes; the
Procurator of the Carmelites preaching on our Savior's
feeding the multitude with five loaves, the ceremony
ends. The sacrament being this day exposed, and the
relics of the Holy Cross, the concourse about the streets
is extraordinary. On Palm-Sunday, there was a great
procession, after a papal mass.</p>
