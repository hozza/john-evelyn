<p>This morning I received the
news of the death of my father-in-law, Sir Richard
Browne, Knt. and Bart., who died at my house at Sayes
Court this day at ten in the morning, after he had
labored under the gout and dropsy for nearly six months,
in the 78th year of his age. The funeral was solemnized
on the 19th at Deptford, with as much decency as the
dignity of the person, and our relation to him, required;
there being invited the Bishop of Rochester, several
noblemen, knights, and all the fraternity of the Trinity
Company, of which he had been Master, and others of
the country. The vicar preached a short but proper
discourse on Psalm xxxix. 10, on the frailty of our mortal
condition, concluding with an ample and well-deserved
eulogy on the defunct, relating to his honorable birth
and ancestors, education, learning in Greek and Latin,
modern languages, travels, public employments, signal
loyalty, character abroad, and particularly the honor of
supporting the Church of England in its public worship
during its persecution by the late rebels' usurpation and
regicide, by the suffrages of divers Bishops, Doctors of
the Church, and others, who found such an asylum in his
house and family at Paris, that in their disputes with the
Papists (then triumphing over it as utterly lost) they
used to argue for its visibility and existence from Sir R.Â Browne's chapel and assembly there. Then he spoke of
his great and loyal sufferings during thirteen years' exile
with his present Majesty, his return with him in the signal
year 1660; his honorable employment at home, his
timely recess to recollect himself, his great age, infirmities,
and death.</p>

<p>He gave to the Trinity Corporation that land in Deptford
on which are built those almshouses for twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
widows of emerited seamen. He was born the famous
year of the Gunpowder Treason, in 1605, and being the
last [male] of his family, left my wife, his only daughter,
heir. His grandfather, Sir Richard Browne, was the great
instrument under the great Earl of Leicester (favorite to
Queen Elizabeth) in his government of the Netherland.
He was Master of the Household to King James, and
Cofferer; I think was the first who regulated the compositions
through England for the King's household,
provisions, progresses,<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_49_49">49</a> etc., which was so high a service,
and so grateful to the whole nation, that he had acknowledgments
and public thanks sent him from all the counties;
he died by the rupture of a vein in a vehement
speech he made about the compositions in a Parliament
of King James. By his mother's side he was a Gunson,
Treasurer of the Navy in the reigns of Henry VIII.,
Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, and, as by his large
pedigree appears, related to divers of the English nobility.
Thus ended this honorable person, after so many
changes and tossings to and fro, in the same house where
he was born. "Lord teach us so to number our days,
that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom!"</p>

<p>By a special clause in his will, he ordered that his
body should be buried in the churchyard under the southeast
window of the chancel, adjoining to the burying
places of his ancestors, since they came out of Essex
into Sayes Court, he being much offended at the novel
custom of burying everyone within the body of the
church and chancel; that being a favor heretofore granted
to martyrs and great persons; this excess of making
churches charnel houses being of ill and irreverend example,
and prejudicial to the health of the living, besides
the continual disturbance of the pavement and seats, and
several other indecencies. Dr. Hall, the pious Bishop of
Norwich, would also be so interred, as may be read in
his testament.</p>
