<p>I went to visit Mr. Waller, an extraordinary
young gentleman of great accomplishments,
skilled in mathematics, anatomy, music, painting both in
oil and miniature to great perfection, an excellent botanist,
a rare engraver on brass, writer in Latin, and a poet;
and with all this exceedingly modest. His house is an
academy of itself. I carried him to see Brompton Park
[by Knightsbridge], where he was in admiration at the
store of rare plants, and the method he found in that
noble nursery, and how well it was cultivated. A public
Bank of £140,000, set up by Act of Parliament among
other Acts, and Lotteries for money to carry on the war.
The whole month of April without rain. A great rising
of people in Buckinghamshire, on the declaration of a
famous preacher, till now reputed a sober and religious
man, that our Lord Christ appearing to him on the 16th
of this month, told him he was now come down, and
would appear publicly at Pentecost, and gather all the
saints, Jews and Gentiles, and lead them to Jerusalem,
and begin the Millennium, and destroying and judging
the wicked, deliver the government of the world to the
saints. Great multitudes followed this preacher, divers
of the most zealous brought their goods and considerable
sums of money, and began to live in imitation of the primitive
saints, minding no private concerns, continually dancing
and singing Hallelujah night and day. This brings
to mind what I lately happened to find in Alstedius, that
the thousand years should begin this very year 1694; it
is in his "Encyclopædia Biblica." My copy of the book
printed near sixty years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>
