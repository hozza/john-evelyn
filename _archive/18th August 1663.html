<p>To London, to see my Lord Chancellor,
where I had discourse with my Lord Archbishop
of Canterbury and the Bishop of Winchester, who enjoined
me to write to Dr. Pierce, President of Magdalen College,
Oxford, about a letter sent him by Dr. Goffe, a
Romish Oratorian, concerning an answer to Dean Cressy's
late book.</p>
