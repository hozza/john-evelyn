<p>I had some discourse with certain
strangers, not unlearned, who had been born not far from
Old Nineveh; they assured me of the ruins being still
extant, and vast and wonderful were the buildings,
vaults, pillars, and magnificent fragments;<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_34_34">34</a> but they
could say little of the Tower of Babel that satisfied me.
But the description of the amenity and fragrancy of the
country for health and cheerfulness, delighted me; so
sensibly they spoke of the excellent air and climate in
respect of our cloudy and splenetic country.</p>
