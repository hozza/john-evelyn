<p>Congratulated the new Lord Treasurer,
Sir Thomas Osborne, a gentleman with whom I had
been intimately acquainted at Paris, and who was every
day at my father-in-law's house and table there; on which
account I was too confident of succeeding in his favor,
as I had done in his predecessor's; but such a friend
shall I never find, and I neglected my time, far from
believing that my Lord Clifford would have so rashly
laid down his staff, as he did, to the amazement of all
the world, when it came to the test of his receiving
the Communion, which I am confident he forbore
more from some promise he had entered into to
gratify the Duke, than from any prejudice to the Protestant
religion, though I found him wavering a pretty
while.</p>
