<p>At Council, we debated the business
of the consulate of Leghorn. I was of the committee
with Sir Humphry Winch, the chairman, to
examine the laws of his Majesty's several plantations and
colonies in the West Indies, etc.</p>

<p>15th November, <a id="tn_png_099"></a><!--TN: Period added after "1672"-->1672. Many merchants were summoned
about the consulate of Venice; which caused great disputes;
the most considerable thought it useless. This
being the Queen-Consort's birthday, there was an extraordinary
appearance of gallantry, and a ball danced at Court.</p>
