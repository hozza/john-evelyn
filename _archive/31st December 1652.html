<p>I adjusted all accompts, and
rendered thanks to Almighty God for his mercies to me
the year past.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAYES COURT</div>

<p>1st January, 1652-53. I set apart in preparation for the
Blessed Sacrament, which the next day Mr.Â Owen administered
to me and all my family in Sayes Court,
preaching on John vi. 32, 33, showing the exceeding
benefits of our blessed Savior taking our nature upon
him. He had christened my son and churched my wife
in our own house as before noticed.</p>
