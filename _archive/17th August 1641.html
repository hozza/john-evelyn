<p>I passed again through Delft, and
visited the church in which was the monument of Prince
William of Nassau,â€”the first of the Williams, and savior
(as they call him) of their liberty, which cost him his life
by a vile assassination. It is a piece of rare art, consisting
of several figures, as big as the life, in copper. There is in
the same place a magnificent tomb of his son and successor,
Maurice. The senate-house hath a very stately
portico, supported with choice columns of black marble,
as I remember, of one entire stone. Within, there hangs
a weighty vessel of wood, not unlike a butter-churn, which
the adventurous woman that hath two husbands at one
time is to wear on her shoulders, her head peeping out
at the top only, and so led about the town, as a penance
for her incontinence. From hence, we went the next day
to Ryswick, a stately country-house of the Prince of
Orange, for nothing more remarkable than the delicious
walks planted with lime trees, and the modern paintings
within.</p>
