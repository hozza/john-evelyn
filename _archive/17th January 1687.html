<p>Much expectation of several great
men declaring themselves Papists. Lord Tyrconnel gone
to succeed the Lord-Lieutenant [Clarendon] in Ireland,
to the astonishment of all sober men, and to the evident
ruin of the Protestants in that kingdom, as well as of
its great improvement going on. Much discourse that
all the White Staff officers and others should be dismissed
for adhering to their religion. Popish Justices
of the Peace established in all counties, of the meanest
of the people; Judges ignorant of the law, and perverting
itâ€”so furiously do the Jesuits drive, and even compel
Princes to violent courses, and destruction of an
excellent government both in Church and State. God of
his infinite mercy open our eyes, and turn our hearts,
and establish his truth with peace! The Lord Jesus
defend his little flock, and preserve this threatened
church and nation!</p>
