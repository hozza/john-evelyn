<p>Dr. Frampton, Bishop of Gloucester,
preached on Psalm xliv. 17, 18, 19, showing the several
afflictions of the Church of Christ from the primitive to
this day, applying exceedingly to the present conjuncture,
when many were wavering in their minds, and great
temptations appearing through the favor now found by
the Papists, so as the people were full of jealousies and
discouragement. The Bishop magnified the Church of
England, exhorting to constancy and perseverance.</p>
