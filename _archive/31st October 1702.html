<p>Arrived now to the 82d year of
my age, having read over all that passed since this day
twelvemonth in these notes, I render solemn thanks to
the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring
that he will continue his assistance, and prepare
me for my blessed Savior's coming, that I may obtain a
comfortable departure, after so long a term as has been
hitherto indulged me. I find by many infirmities this
year (especially nephritic pains) that I much decline;
and yet of his infinite mercy retain my intellect and
senses in great measure above most of my age. I have
this year repaired much of the mansion house and several
tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.
My wife, children, and family in health: for all
which I most sincerely beseech Almighty God to accept
of these my acknowledgments, and that if it be his holy
will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul. Amen!</p>
