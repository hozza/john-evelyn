<p>I heard a sermon at Mr. Packer's
chapel at Groomsbridge, a pretty melancholy seat, well
wooded and watered. In this house was one of the
French kings<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_45_45">45</a> kept prisoner. The chapel was built
by Mr. Packer's father, in remembrance of King Charles
the First's safe return out of Spain.</p>
