<p>His Majesty was pleased to grant
me a lease of a slip of ground out of Brick Close, to
enlarge my fore-court, for which I now gave him thanks;
then, entering into other discourse, he talked to me of a
new varnish for ships, instead of pitch, and of the gilding
with which his new yacht was beautified. I showed his
Majesty the perpetual motion sent to me by Dr. Stokes,
from Cologne; and then came in Monsieur Colbert, the
French Ambassador.</p>
