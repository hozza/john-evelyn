<p>I dined at my Lord Privy Seal's with
Sir William Dugdale, Garter King-at-Arms, author of
the "<span class="smcap">Monasticon</span>" and other learned works; he told me
he was 82 years of age, and had his sight and memory
perfect. There was shown a draft of the exact shape
and dimensions of the crown the Queen had been crowned
withal, together with the jewels and pearls, their weight
and value, which amounted to Â£100,658 sterling, attested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
at the foot of the paper by the jeweler and goldsmith
who set them.</p>
