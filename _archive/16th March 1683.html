<p>I went to see Sir Josiah Child's
prodigious cost in planting walnut trees about his seat,
and making fish ponds, many miles in circuit, in Epping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Forest, in a barren spot, as oftentimes these suddenly
monied men for the most part seat themselves. He from
a merchant's apprentice, and management of the East
India Company's stock, being arrived to an estate (it is
said) of £200,000; and lately married his daughter to
the eldest son of the Duke of Beaufort, late Marquis of
Worcester, with £50,000 portional present, and various
expectations.</p>

<p>I dined at Mr. Houblon's, a rich and gentle French
merchant, who was building a house in the Forest, near
Sir J. Child's, in a place where the late Earl of Norwich
dwelt some time, and which came from his lady, the
widow of Mr. Baker. It will be a pretty villa, about
five miles from Whitechapel.</p>
