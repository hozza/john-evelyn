<p>I went to London to visit my
Lord of Bristol, having been with Sir John Denham (his
Majesty's surveyor) to consult with him about the placing
of his palace at Greenwich, which I would have had
built between the river and the Queen's house, so as a
large square cut should have let in the Thames like a
bay; but Sir John was for setting it on piles at the very
brink of the water, which I did not assent to; and so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
came away, knowing Sir John to be a better poet than
architect, though he had Mr.Â Webb (Inigo Jones's man)
to assist him.</p>
