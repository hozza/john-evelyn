<p>I went to visit that ancient See
and Cathedral of St. John di Laterano, and the holy
places thereabout. This is a church of extraordinary
devotion, though, for outward form, not comparable to
St. Peter's, being of Gothic ordonnance. Before we went
into the cathedral, the Baptistery of St. John Baptist
presented itself, being formerly part of the Great Constantine's
palace, and, as it is said, his chamber where
by St. Silvester he was made a Christian. It is of an
octagonal shape, having before the entrance eight fair
pillars of rich porphyry, each of one entire piece, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
capitals of divers orders, supporting lesser columns of
white marble, and these supporting a noble cupola, the
molding whereof is excellently wrought. In the chapel
which they affirm to have been the lodging place of this
Emperor, all women are prohibited from entering, for
the malice of Herodias who caused him to lose his head.
Here are deposited several sacred relics of St. James,
Mary Magdalen, St. Matthew, etc., and two goodly pictures.
Another chapel, or oratory near it, is called St. John the
Evangelist, well adorned with marbles and tables, especially
those of Cavaliére Giuseppe, and of Tempesta,
in fresco. We went hence into another called St. Venantius,
in which is a tribunal all of <a id="tn_png_150"></a><!--TN: "Mosiac" changed to "Mosaic"-->Mosaic in figures
of Popes. Here is also an altar of the Madonna, much
visited, and divers Sclavonish saints, companions of Pope
John IV. The portico of the church is built of materials
brought from Pontius Pilate's house in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The next sight which attracted our attention, was a
wonderful concourse of people at their devotions before
a place called <i>Scala Sancta</i>, to which is built a noble
front. Entering the portico, we saw those large marble
stairs, twenty-eight in number, which are never ascended
but on the knees, some lip-devotion being used on every
step; on which you may perceive divers red specks of
blood under a grate, which they affirm to have been
drops of our Blessed Savior, at the time he was so barbarously
misused by Herod's soldiers; for these stairs are
reported to have been translated hither from his palace
in Jerusalem. At the top of them is a chapel, whereat
they enter (but we could not be permitted) by gates of
marble, being the same our Savior passed when he went
out of Herod's house. This they name the <i>Sanctum Sanctorum</i>,
and over it we read this epigraph:</p>

<p class="centerquot"><i>Non est in toto sanctior orbe locus.</i></p>

<p>Here, through a grate, we saw that picture of Christ
painted (as they say) by the hand of St. Luke, to the
life. Descending again, we saw before the church the
obelisk, which is indeed most worthy of admiration. It
formerly lay in the Circo Maximo, and was erected here
by Sextus V., in 1587, being 112 feet in height without
the base or pedestal; at the foot nine and a half one
way, and eight the other. This pillar was first brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
from Thebes at the utmost confines of Egypt, to Alexandria,
from thence to Constantinople, thence to Rome,
and is said by Ammianus Marcellinus to have been dedicated
to Rameses, King of Egypt. It was transferred to
this city by Constantine the son of the Great, and is full
of hieroglyphics, serpents, men, owls, falcons, oxen, instruments,
etc., containing (as Father Kircher the Jesuit
will shortly tell us in a book which he is ready to publish)
all the recondite and abstruse learning of that people.
The vessel, galley, or float, that brought it to Rome so
many hundred leagues, must needs have been of wonderful
bigness and strange fabric. The stone is one and
entire, and (having been thrown down) was erected by
the famous Dom. Fontana, for that magnificent Pope,
Sextus V., as the rest were; it is now cracked in many
places, but solidly joined. The obelisk is thus inscribed
at the several faciátas:</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Fl. Constantinus Augustus, Constantini Augusti F. Obeliscum
à patre suo motum diuq; Alexandriæ jacentem, trecentorum remigum
impositum navi mirandæ vastitatis per mare Tyberimq;
magnis molibus Romam convectum in Circo Max. ponendum <a id="tn_png_151a"></a><!--TN: "S.P. Q.R.D.D." changed to "S.P.Q.R.D.D."-->S.P.Q.R.D.D.</i></p>

<p>On the second square:</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Fl. Constantinus Max: Aug: Christianæ fidei Vindex &amp; Assertor
Obeliscum ab Ægyptio Rege impuro voto Soli dicatum, sedibus
avulsum suis per Nilum transfer. Alexandriam, ut Novam
Romam ab se <a id="tn_png_151b"></a><!--TN: "tune" changed to "tunc"-->tunc conditam eo decoraret monumento.</i></p>

<p>On the third:</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i><a id="tn_png_151"></a><!--TN: "Sextns" changed to "Sextus"-->Sextus V. Pontifex Max: Obeliscum hunc specie eximiâ temporum

formàq; pristinâ accuratè vestitum, Cruci invictissimæ dicavit

<p>On the fourth:</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Constantinus per Crucem Victor à Silvestro hìc Baptizatus Crucis
gloriam propagavit.</i></p>

<p>Leaving this wonderful monument (before which is a
stately public fountain, with a statue of St. John in the
middle of it), we visited His Holiness's palace, being a
little on the left hand, the design of Fontana, architect
to Sextus V. This I take to be one of the best palaces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
in Rome; but not staying we entered the church of St.
John di Laterano, which is properly the Cathedral of
the Roman See, as I learned by these verses engraven
upon the architrave of the portico:</p>

<div class="centerpoem" style="font-style:italic;">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Dogmate Papali datur, et simul Imperiali<br></span>
<span class="i0">Quòd sim cunctarum mater caput Ecclesiarŭ<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hinc Salvatoris cœlestia regna datoris<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nomine Sanxerunt, cum cuncta peracta fuerunt;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sic vos ex toto conversi supplice voto<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nostra quòd hæc ædes; tibi Christe sit inclyta sedes.</span>
</div></div>

<p>It is called Lateran, from a noble family formerly
dwelling it seems hereabouts, on Mons Cælius. The
church is Gothic, and hath a stately tribunal; the paintings
are of Pietro Pisano. It was the first church that
was consecrated with the ceremonies now introduced,
and where altars of stone supplied those of wood heretofore
in use, and made like large chests for the easier
removal in times of persecution; such an altar is still the
great one here preserved, as being that on which (they
hold) St. Peter celebrated mass at Rome; for which
reason none but the Pope may now presume to make
that use of it. The pavement is of all sorts of precious
marbles, and so are the walls to a great height, over
which it is painted <i>á fresco</i> with the life and acts of
Constantine the Great, by most excellent masters. The
organs are rare, supported by four columns. The <i>soffito</i>
is all richly gilded, and full of pictures. Opposite to the
porta is an altar of exquisite architecture, with a tabernacle
on it all of precious stones, the work of Targoni;
on this is a <i>cœna</i> of plate, the invention of Curtius
Vanni, of exceeding value; the tables hanging over it
are of Giuseppe d'Arpino. About this are four excellent
columns transported out of Asia by the Emperor Titus,
of brass, double gilt, about twelve feet in height; the
walls between them are incrusted with marble and set
with statues in niches, the vacuum reported to be filled
with holy earth, which St. Helena sent from Jerusalem
to her son, Constantine, who set these pillars where they
now stand. At one side of this is an oratory full of rare
paintings and monuments, especially those of the great
Connestábile Colonna. Out of this we came into the
<i>sacristia</i>, full of good pictures of Albert and others. At
the end of the church is a flat stone supported by four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
pillars which they affirm to have been the exact height
of our Blessed Savior, and say they never fitted any
mortal man that tried it, but he was either taller or
shorter; two columns of the veil of the Temple which
rent at his passion; the stone on which they threw lots
for his seamless vesture; and the pillar on which the
cock crowed, after Peter's denial; and, to omit no fine
thing, the just length of the Virgin Mary's foot as it
seems her shoemaker affirmed! Here is a sumptuous
cross, beset with precious stones, containing some of the
VERY wood of the holy cross itself; with many other
things of this sort: also numerous most magnificent
monuments, especially those of St. Helena, of porphyry;
Cardinal Farneze; Martin I., of copper; the pictures of
Mary Magdalen, Martin V., Laurentius Valla, etc., are of
Gaetano; the Nunciata, designed by M. Angelo; and the
great crucifix of Sermoneta. In a chapel at one end of
the porch is a statue of Henry IV. of France, in brass,
standing in a dark hole, and so has done many years;
perhaps from not believing him a thorough proselyte.
The two famous œcumenical Councils were celebrated
in this Church by Pope Simachus, Martin I., Stephen,
etc.</p>

<p>Leaving this venerable church (for in truth it has a
certain majesty in it), we passed through a fair and large
hospital of good architecture, having some inscriptions
put up by Barberini, the late Pope's nephew. We then
went by St. Sylvia, where is a noble statue of St. Gregory
P., begun by M. Angelo; a St. Andrew, and the
bath of St. Cecilia. In this church are some rare paintings,
especially that story on the wall of Guido Reni.
Thence to St. Giovanni e Paula, where the friars are
reputed to be great chemists. The choir, roof, and paintings
in the <i>tribuna</i> are excellent.</p>

<p>Descending the Mons Cælius, we came against the vestiges
of the Palazzo Maggiore, heretofore the Golden
House of Nero; now nothing but a heap of vast and
confused ruins, to show what time and the vicissitude of
human things does change from the most glorious and
magnificent to the most deformed and confused. We
next went into St. Sebastian's Church, which has a handsome
front: then we passed by the place where Romulus
and Remus were taken up by Faustulus, the Forum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Romanum, and so by the edge of the Mons Palatinus;
where we saw the ruins of Pompey's house, and the
Church of St. Anacletus; and so into the Circus Maximus,
heretofore capable of containing a hundred and sixty
thousand spectators, but now all one entire heap of rubbish,
part of it converted into a garden of pot herbs.
We concluded this evening with hearing the rare voices
and music at the Chiesa Nova.</p>
