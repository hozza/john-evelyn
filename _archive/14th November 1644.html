<p>We passed again through the
stately Capitol and Campo Vaccino toward the Amphitheater
of Vespasian, but first stayed to look at Titus's
Triumphal Arch, erected by the people of Rome, in
honor of his victory at Jerusalem; on the left hand
whereof he is represented drawn in a chariot with four
horses abreast; on the right hand, or side of the arch
within, is sculptured in figures, or basso-relievo as big
as the life (and in one entire marble) the Ark of the
Covenant, on which stands the seven-branched candlestick
described in Leviticus, as also the two Tables of
the Law, all borne on men's shoulders by the bars, as
they are described in some of St. Hierom's bibles; before
this, go many crowned and laureated figures, and
twelve Roman <i>fasces</i> with other sacred vessels. This
much confirmed the idea I before had; and therefore, for
the light it gave to the Holy History, I caused my
painter, Carlo, to copy it exactly. The rest of the work
of the Arch is of the noblest, best understood <i>composita</i>;
and the inscription is this, in capital letters:</p>

<p class="centerquot" style="line-height:1.4">S. P. Q. R.<br>
D. TITO, D. VESPASIANI, F. VESPASIANI AVGVSTO.</p>


<p>Santa Maria Nova is on the place where they told us
Simon Magus fell out of the air at St. Peter's prayer,
and burst himself to pieces on a flint. Near this is a
marble monument, erected by the people of Rome in
memory of the Pope's return from Avignon.
Being now passed the ruins of Meta-Sudante (which
stood before the Colosseum, so called, because there once
stood here the statue of Commodus provided to refresh
the gladiators), we enter the mighty ruins of the Vespasian
Amphitheatre, begun by Vespasian, and finished
by that excellent prince, Titus. It is 830 Roman palms
in length (<i>i.e.</i> 130 paces), 90 in breadth at the area,
with caves for the wild beasts which used to be baited
by men instead of dogs; the whole oval periphery 2888-4/7
palms, and capable of containing 87,000 spectators with
ease and all accommodation: the three rows of circles are
yet entire; the first was for the senators, the middle for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the nobility, the third for the people. At the dedication
of this place were 5,000 wild beasts slain in three months
during which the feast lasted, to the expense of ten
millions of gold. It was built of Tiburtine stone, a vast
height, with the five orders of architecture, by 30,000
captive Jews. It is without, of a perfect circle, and was
once adorned thick with statues, and remained entire,
till of late that some of the stones were carried away to
repair the city walls and build the Farnesian palace.
That which still appears most admirable is, the contrivance
of the porticos, vaults, and stairs, with the excessive
altitude, which well deserves this distich of the poet:</p>

<div class="centerpoem">
<div class="poem">
<span class="ia">"<i>Omnis CÃ¦sareo cedat labor Amphitheatro;</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Unum pro cunctis fama loquatur opus.</i>"<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Near it is a small chapel called Santa Maria della Pieta
nel Colisseo, which is erected on the steps, or stages, very
lofty at one of its sides, or ranges, within, and where there
lives only a melancholy hermit. I ascended to the very
top of it with wonderful admiration.</p>

<p>The Arch of Constantine the Great is close by the
Meta-Sudante, before mentioned, at the beginning of the
Via Appia, on one side Monte Celio, and is perfectly entire,
erected by the people in memory of his victory over Maxentius,
at the Pons Milvius, now Ponte Mole. In the front
is this inscription:</p>

<p class="centerquot" style="line-height:1.4">
IMP. CAES. FL. CONSTANTINO MAXIMO<br>
P. F. AVGVSTO S. P. Q. R.<br>
QVOD INSTINCTV DIVINITATIS MENTIS<br>
MAGNITVDINE CVM EXERCITV SVO<br>
TAM DE TYRANNO QVAM DE OMNI EIVS<br>
FACTIONE VNO TEMPORE IVSTIS<br>
REMPVBLICAM VLTVS EST ARMIS<br>
ARCVM TRIVMPHIS INSIGNEM DICAVIT.</p>

<p>Hence, we went to St. Gregorio, in Monte Celio, where
are many privileged altars, and there they showed us an
arm of that saint, and other relics. Before this church
stands a very noble portico.</p>
