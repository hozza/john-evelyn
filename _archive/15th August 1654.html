Forest, accounted the most extensive in England. Then,
Paplewick, an incomparable vista with the pretty castle
near it. Thence, we saw Newstead Abbey, belonging to
the Lord Byron, situated much like Fontainebleau in

park, and environed with woods, a noble yet melancholy
seat. The palace is a handsome and stately building.
Next to Worksop Abbey, almost demolished; the church
has a double flat tower entire, and a pretty gate. The
manor belongs to the Earl of Arundel, and has to it
a fair house at the foot of a hill in a park that affords
a delicate prospect. Tickel, a town and castle, has a
