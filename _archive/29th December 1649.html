<p>I christened Sir Hugh Rilie's
child with Sir George Radcliffe in our chapel, the parents
being so poor that they had provided no gossips,
so as several of us drawing lots it fell on me, the
Dean of Peterborough (Dr. Cousin) officiating: we named
it Andrew, being on the eve of that Apostle's day.</p>

<p>1st January, 1649-50. I began this Jubilee with the
public office in our chapel: dined at my Lady Herbert's,
wife of Sir Edward Herbert, afterward Lord Keeper.</p>
