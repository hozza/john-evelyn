<p>Was the coronation of the King and
Queen. The solemnity was magnificent as is set forth
in print. The Bishop of Ely preached; but, to the sorrow
of the people, no Sacrament, as ought to have been.
However, the King begins his reign with great expectations,
and hopes of much reformation as to the late
vices and profaneness of both Court and country. Having
been present at the late King's coronation, I was not
ambitious of seeing this ceremony.</p>
