<p>Saw the audience of the Muscovy
Ambassador, which was with extraordinary state,
his retinue being numerous, all clad in vests of several
colors, with buskins, after the Eastern manner! their caps
of fur; tunics, richly embroidered with gold and pearls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
made a glorious show. The King being seated under a
canopy in the Banqueting House, the Secretary of the
Embassy went before the Ambassador in a grave march,
holding up his master's letters of credence in a crimson
taffeta scarf before his forehead. The Ambassador then
delivered it with a profound reverence to the King, who
gave it to our Secretary of State: it was written in a long
and lofty style. Then came in the presents, borne by
165 of his retinue, consisting of mantles and other large
pieces lined with sable, black fox, and ermine; Persian
carpets, the ground cloth of gold and velvet; hawks, such
as they said never came the like; horses said to be Persian;
bows and arrows, etc. These borne by so long a
train rendered it very extraordinary. Wind music played
all the while in the galleries above. This finished, the
Ambassador was conveyed by the master of the ceremonies
to York House, where he was treated with a banquet,
which cost Â£200, as I was assured.</p>
