<p>We dined at Sienna, where we could
not pass admiring the great church built entirely both
within and without with white and black marble in polished
squares, by Macarino, showing so beautiful after
a shower has fallen. The floor within is of various colored
marbles, representing the story of both Testaments,
admirably wrought. Here lies Pius II. The bibliotéca
is painted by P. Perrugino and Raphael. The life of
Æneas Sylvius is in <span style="font-size:.8em;">FRESCO</span>; in the middle are the
Three Graces, in antique marble, very curious, and the
front of this building, though Gothic, is yet very fine.
Among other things, they show St. Catharine's disciplining
cell, the door whereof is half cut out into
chips by the pilgrims and devotees, being of deal wood.</p>

<p>Setting out hence for Pisa, we went again to see the
Duomo in which the Emperor Henry VII. lies buried,
poisoned by a monk in the Eucharist. The bending tower
was built by Busqueto Delichio, a Grecian architect, and
is a stupendous piece of art. In the gallery of curiosities
is a fair <a id="tn_png_213"></a><!--TN: Colon changed to semicolon after "mummy"-->mummy; the tail of a sea-horse; coral growing

three or four small worms; two embalmed children; divers
petrifactions, etc. The garden of simples is well furnished,
and has in it the deadly yew, or <i>taxus</i>, of the ancients;
which Dr. Belluccio, the superintendent, affirms that his
workmen cannot endure to clip for above the space of
half an hour at a time, from the pain of the head which
surprises them.</p>

<p>We went hence from Leghorn, by coach, where I took
up ninety crowns for the rest of my journey, with letters
of credit for Venice, after I had sufficiently complained
of my defeat of correspondence at Rome.</p>

<p>The next day, I came to Lucca, a small but pretty
territory and state of itself. The city is neat and well
fortified, with noble and pleasant walks of trees on the
works, where the gentry and ladies used to take the air.
It is situate on an ample plain by the river Serchio, yet
the country about it is hilly. The Senate-house is magnificent.
The church of St. Michael is a noble piece, as
is also St. Fredian, more remarkable to us for the corpse
of St. Richard, an English king,<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_31_31">31</a> who died here on his
pilgrimage toward Rome. This epitaph is on his tomb:</p>

<div class="centerpoem" style="font-style:italic;">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Hic rex Richardus requiescit, sceptifer, almus;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rex Fuit Anglorum; regnum tenet iste Polorum.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Regnum demisit; pro Christo cuncta reliquit.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ergo, Richardum nobis debit Anglia sanctum.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hic genitor Sanctæ Wulburgæ Virginis almæ<br></span>
<span class="i0">Est Vrillebaldi sancti simul et Vinebaldi,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Suffragium quorum nobis det regna Polorum.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Next this, we visited St. Croce, an excellent structure
all of marble both without and within, and so adorned
as may vie with many of the fairest even in Rome: witness
the huge cross, valued at £15,000, above all venerable
for that sacred <i>volto</i> which (as tradition goes) was
miraculously put on the image of Christ, and made by
Nicodemus, while the artist, finishing the rest of the
body, was meditating what face to set on it. The inhabitants
are exceedingly civil to strangers, above all
places in Italy, and they speak the purest Italian. It is
also cheap living, which causes travelers to set up their
rest here more than in Florence, though a more cele<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>brated
city; besides, the ladies here are very conversable,
and the religious women not at all reserved; of these we
bought gloves and embroidered stomachers, generally
worn by gentlemen in these countries. The circuit of
this state is but two easy days' journey, and lies mixed
with the Duke of Tuscany's but having Spain for a protector
(though the least bigoted of all Roman Catholics),
and being one of the fortified cities in Italy, it remains
in peace. The whole country abounds in excellent
olives, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PISTORIA</div>

<p>Going hence for Florence, we dined at Pistoria, where,
besides one church, there was little observable: only in
the highway we crossed a rivulet of salt water, though
many miles from the sea. The country is extremely
pleasant, full of gardens, and the roads straight as a line
for the best part of that whole day, the hedges planted
with trees at equal distances, watered with clear and
plentiful streams.</p>

<p>Rising early the next morning we arrived at Peggio Imperiale,
being a palace of the Great Duke, not far
from the city, having omitted it in my passage to Rome.
The ascent to the house is by a stately gallery as it were
of tall and overgrown cypress trees for near half a mile.
At the entrance of these ranges, are placed statues of the
Tiber and Arno, of marble; those also of Virgil, Ovid,
Petrarch, and Dante. The building is sumptuous, and
curiously furnished within with cabinets of pietra-commessa
in tables, pavements, etc., which is a magnificence,
or work, particularly affected at Florence. The pictures
are, Adam and Eve by Albert Durer, very excellent; as
is that piece of carving in wood by the same hand standing
in a cupboard. Here is painted the whole Austrian
line; the Duke's mother, sister to the Emperor, the foundress
of this palace, than which there is none in Italy
that I had seen more magnificently adorned, or furnished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLORENCE</div>

<p>We could not omit in our passage to re-visit the same,
and other curiosities which we had neglected on our first
being at Florence. We went, therefore, to see the famous
piece of Andrea del Sarto, in the Annunciata. The story
is, that the painter in a time of dearth borrowed a sack of
corn of the religious of that convent, and repayment being
demanded, he wrought it out in this picture, which represents
Joseph sitting on a sack of corn, and reading to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Blessed Virgin; a piece infinitely valued. There fell down
in the cloister an old man's face painted on the wall in
<i>fresco</i>, greatly esteemed, and broke into crumbs; the
Duke sent his best painters to make another instead of
it, but none of them would presume to touch a pencil
where Andrea had wrought, like another Apelles; but
one of them was so industrious and patient, that, picking
up the fragments, he laid and fastened them so
artificially together, that the injury it had received was
hardly discernible. Andrea del Sarto lies buried in the
same place. Here is also that picture of Bartolomeo,
who having spent his utmost skill in the face of the angel
Gabriel, and being troubled that he could not exceed it in
the Virgin, he began the body and to finish the clothes,
and so left it, minding in the morning to work on the face;
but, when he came, no sooner had he drawn away the cloth
that was hung before it to preserve it from the dust, than
an admirable and ravishing face was found ready painted;
at which miracle all the city came in to worship. It is now
kept in the Chapel of the Salutation, a place so enriched by
devotees, that none in Italy, save Loretto, is said to exceed
it. This picture is always covered with three shutters, one
of which is of massy silver; methinks it is very brown, the
forehead and cheeks whiter, as if it had been scraped.
They report that those who have the honor of seeing it
never lose their sight—happy then we! Belonging to this
church is a world of plate, some whole statues of it, and
lamps innumerable, besides the costly vows hung up, some
of gold, and a cabinet of precious stones.</p>

<p>Visiting the Duke's repository again, we told at
least forty ranks of porphyry and other statues, and
twenty-eight whole figures, many rare paintings and relievos,
two square columns with trophies. In one of the
galleries, twenty-four figures, and fifty antique heads; a
Bacchus of M. Angelo, and one of Bandinelli; a head of
Bernini, and a most lovely Cupid, of Parian marble; at
the further end, two admirable women sitting, and a man
fighting with a centaur; three figures in little of Andrea;
a huge candlestick of amber; a table of Titian's painting,
and another representing God the Father sitting in the
air on the Four Evangelists; animals; divers smaller
pieces of Raphael; a piece of pure virgin gold, as big as
an egg. In the third chamber of rarities is the square<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
cabinet, valued at 80,000 crowns, showing on every front,
a variety of curious work; one of birds and flowers, of
<i>pietra-commessa</i>; one, a descent from the cross, of M.
Angelo; on the third, our Blessed Savior and the Apostles,
of amber; and, on the fourth, a crucifix of the same.
Between the pictures, two naked Venuses, by Titian;
Adam and Eve, by Durer; and several pieces of Portdenone,
and del Frate. There is a globe of six feet diameter.
In the Armory, were an entire elk, a crocodile, and
among the harness, several targets and antique horse-arms,
as that of Charles V.; two set with turquoises, and
other precious stones; a horse's tail, of a wonderful
length. Then, passing the Old Palace, which has a very
great hall for feasts and comedies, the roof rarely painted,
and the side walls with six very large pictures representing
battles, the work of Gio. Vassari. Here is a magazine
full of plate; a harness of emeralds; the furnitures
of an altar four feet high, and six in length, of massy
gold; in the middle is placed the statue of Cosmo
II., the bass-relievo is of precious stones, his breeches
covered with diamonds; the moldings of this statue, and
other ornaments, festoons, etc., are garnished with jewels
and great pearls, dedicated to St. Charles, with this inscription,
in rubies:</p>

<p class="centerquot">"<i>Cosimus Secundus Dei gratiâ Magnus Dux Etruriæ ex voto.</i>"</p>

<p class="continue">There is also a King on horseback, of massy gold, two
feet high, and an infinity of such like rarities. Looking
at the Justice, in copper, set up on a column by Cosmo,
in 1555, after the victory over Sienna, we were told that
the Duke, asking a gentleman how he liked the piece, he
answered, that he liked it very well, but that it stood too
high for poor men to come at it.</p>

<p>Prince Leopold has, in this city, a very excellent collection
of paintings, especially a St. Catherine of P. Veronese;
a Venus of marble, veiled from the middle to the
feet, esteemed to be of that Greek workman who made
the Venus at the Medici's Palace in Rome, altogether as
good, and better preserved, an inestimable statue, not
long since found about Bologna.</p>

<p>Signor Gaddi is a lettered person, and has divers rarities,
statues, and pictures of the best masters, and one
bust of marble as much esteemed as the most antique in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Italy, and many curious manuscripts; his best paintings
are, a Virgin of del Sarto, mentioned by Vassari, a St.
John, by Raphael, and an <i>Ecce Homo</i>, by Titian.</p>

<p>The hall of the Academy de la Crusca is hung about
with impresses and devices painted, all of them relating
to corn sifted from the bran; the seats are made like
breadbaskets and other rustic instruments used about
wheat, and the cushions of satin, like sacks.</p>

<p>We took our farewell of St. Laurence, more particularly
noticing that piece of the Resurrection, which consists of a
prodigious number of naked figures, the work of Pontormo.
On the left hand is the Martyrdom of St. Laurence, by
Bronzino, rarely painted indeed. In a chapel is the tomb
of Pietro di Medici, and his brother John, of copper,
excellently designed, standing on two lions' feet, which
end in foliage, the work of M. Angelo. Over against this,
are sepulchres of all the ducal family. The altar has a
statue of the Virgin giving suck, and two Apostles.
Paulus Jovius has the honor to be buried in the cloister.
Behind the choir is the superb chapel of Ferdinand I.,
consisting of eight faces, four plain, four a little hollowed;
in the other are to be the sepulchres, and a niche of
paragon, for the statue of the prince now living, all of
copper gilt; above, is a large table of porphyry, for an
inscription for the Duke, in letters of jasper. The whole
chapel, walls, pavement, and roof, are full of precious
stones united with the moldings, which are also of gilded
copper, and so are the bases and capitals of the columns.
The tabernacle, with the whole altar, is inlaid with cornelians,
lazuli, serpentine, agates, onyxes, etc. On the
other side are six very large columns of rock crystal,
eight figures of precious stones of several colors, inlaid in
natural figures, not inferior to the best paintings, among
which are many pearls, diamonds, amethysts, topazes,
sumptuous and sparkling beyond description. The windows
without side are of white marble. The library is
the architecture of Raphael; before the port is a square
vestibule of excellent art, of all the orders, without confusion;
the ascent to it from the library is excellent.
We numbered eighty-eight shelves, all MSS. and bound in
red, chained; in all about 3,500 volumes, as they told us.</p>

<p>The Arsenal has sufficient to arm 70,000 men, accurately
preserved and kept, with divers lusty pieces of <a id="tn_png_218"></a><!--TN: Period changed to comma after "ordnance"-->ordnance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
whereof one is for a ball of 300 pounds weight, and
another for 160, which weighs 72,500 pounds.</p>

<p>When I was at Florence, the celebrated masters were:
for <i>pietra-commessa</i> (a kind of mosaic, or inlaying, of
various colored marble, and other more precious stones),
Dominico Benetti and Mazotti; the best statuary, Vincentio
Brochi. This statuary makes those small figures in plaster
and pasteboard, which so resemble copper that, till one
handles them, they cannot be distinguished, he has so rare
an art of bronzing them; I bought four of him. The best
painter, Pietro Beretino di Cortona.</p>

<p>This Duke has a daily tribute for every courtezan, or
prostitute, allowed to practice that infamous trade in his
dominions, and so has his Holiness the Pope, but not so
much in value.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOLOGNA</div>

<p>Taking leave of our two jolly companions, Signor Giovanni
and his fellow, we took horses for Bologna; and,
by the way, alighted at a villa of the Grand Duke's,
called Pratolino. The house is a square of four pavilions,
with a fair platform about it, balustred with stone,
situate in a large meadow, ascending like an amphitheater,
having at the bottom a huge rock, with water running
in a small channel, like a cascade; on the other
side, are the gardens. The whole place seems consecrated
to pleasure and summer retirement. The inside
of the palace may compare with any in Italy for furniture
of tapestry, beds, etc., and the gardens are delicious,
and full of fountains. In the grove sits Pan feeding
his flock, the water making a melodious sound through
his pipe; and a Hercules, whose club yields a shower of
water, which, falling into a great shell, has a naked
woman riding on the backs of dolphins. In another
grotto is Vulcan and his family, the walls richly composed
of corals, shells, copper, and marble figures, with
the hunting of several beasts, moving by the force of
water. Here, having been well washed for our curiosity,
we went down a large walk, at the sides whereof several
slender streams of water gush out of pipes concealed underneath,
that interchangeably fall into each other's channels,
making a lofty and perfect arch, so that a man on
horseback may ride under it, and not receive one drop
of wet. This canopy, or arch of water, I thought one
of the most surprising magnificences I had ever seen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and very refreshing in the heat of the summer. At the
end of this very long walk, stands a woman in white
marble, in posture of a laundress wringing water out of
a piece of linen, very naturally formed, into a vast laver,
the work and invention of M. Angelo Buonarotti. Hence,
we ascended Mount Parnassus, where the Muses played
to us on hydraulic organs. Near this is a great aviary.
All these waters came from the rock in the garden, on
which is the statue of a giant representing the Apennines,
at the foot of which stands this villa. Last of all,
we came to the labyrinth, in which a huge colosse of
Jupiter throws out a stream over the garden. This is
fifty feet in height, having in his body a square chamber,
his eyes and mouth serving for windows and door.</p>

<p>We took horse and supped that night at Il Ponte, passing
a dreadful ridge of the Apennines, in many places
capped with snow, which covers them the whole summer.
We then descended into a luxurious and rich plain. The
next day we passed through Scarperia, mounting the
hills again, where the passage is so straight and precipitous
toward the right hand, that we climbed them with
much care and danger; lodging at Firenzuolo, which is
a fort built among the rocks, and defending the confines
of the Great Duke's territories.</p>

<p>The next day we passed by the Pietramala, a burning
mountain. At the summit of this prodigious mass
of hills, we had an unpleasant way to Pianura, where we
slept that night and were entertained with excellent
wine. Hence to Scargalasino, and to bed at Loiano.
This plain begins about six miles from Bologna.</p>

<p>Bologna belongs to the Pope, and is a famous University,
situate in one of the richest spots of Europe for all
sorts of provisions. It is built like a ship, whereof the
Torre d'Asinelli may go for the mainmast. The city is
of no great strength, having a trifling wall about it, in
circuit near five miles, and two in length. This Torre
d'Asinelli, ascended by 447 steps of a foot rise, seems
exceedingly high, is very narrow, and the more conspicuous
from another tower called Garisendi, so artificially
built of brick (which increases the wonder) that it
seems ready to fall. It is not now so high as the other;
but they say the upper part was formerly taken down,
for fear it should really fall, and do mischief.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Next, we went to see an imperfect church, called St.
Petronius, showing the intent of the founder, had he
gone on. From this, our guide led us to the schools, which
indeed are very magnificent. Thence to St. Dominic's,
where that saint's body lies richly enshrined. The stalls,
or seats, of this goodly church have the history of the Bible
inlaid with several woods, very curiously done, the work
of one Fr. Damiano di Bergamo, and a friar of that
order. Among other relics, they show the two books of
Esdras, written with his own hand. Here lie buried Jac.
Andreas, and divers other learned persons. To the
church joins the convent, in the quadrangle whereof are
old cypresses, said to have been planted by their saint.</p>

<p>Then we went to the palace of the Legate; a fair
brick building, as are most of the houses and buildings,
full of excellent carving and moldings, so as nothing in
stone seems to be better finished or more ornamental; witness
those excellent columns to be seen in many of their
churches, convents, and public buildings; for the whole
town is so cloistered, that one may pass from house to
house through the streets without being exposed either
to rain or sun.</p>

<p>Before the stately hall of this palace stands the statue
of Paul IV. and divers others; also the monument of
the coronation of Charles V. The piazza before it is
the most stately in Italy, St. Mark's at Venice only excepted.
In the center of it is a fountain of Neptune, a
noble figure in copper. Here I saw a Persian walking
about in a rich vest of cloth of tissue, and several other
ornaments, according to the fashion of his country, which
much pleased me; he was a young handsome person, of
the most stately mien.</p>

<p>I would fain have seen the library of St. Savior, famous
for the number of rare manuscripts; but could not,
so we went to St. Francis, a glorious pile, and exceedingly
adorned within.</p>

<p>After dinner I inquired out a priest and Dr. Montalbano,
to whom I brought recommendations from Rome:
this learned person invented, or found out, the composition
of the <i>lapis illuminabilis</i>, or phosphorus. He showed
me their property (for he had several), being to retain
the light of the sun for some competent time, by a kind
of imbibition, by a particular way of calcination. Some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of these presented a blue color, like the flame of brimstone,
others like coals of a kitchen fire. The rest of
the afternoon was taken up in St. Michael in Bosco,
built on a steep hill on the edge of the city, for its
fabric, pleasant shade and groves, cellars, dormitory, and
prospects, one of the most delicious retirements I ever
saw; art and nature contending which shall exceed; so
as till now I never envied the life of a friar. The whole
town and country to a vast extent are under command
of their eyes, almost as far as Venice itself. In this
convent there are many excellent paintings of Guido
Reni; above all, the little cloister of eight faces, painted
by Caracci in <i>fresco</i>. The carvings in wood, in the
sacristy, are admirable, as is the inlaid work about the
chapel, which even emulates the best paintings; the work
is so delicate and tender. The paintings of the Savior
are of Caracci and Leonardo, and there are excellent
things of Raphael which we could not see.</p>

<p>In the church of St. John is a fine piece of St. Cecilia,
by Raphael. As to other paintings, there is in the
church of St. Gregory an excellent picture of a Bishop
giving the habit of St. Bernard to an armed soldier,
with several other figures in the piece, the work of
Guerchino. Indeed, this city is full of rare pieces, especially
of Guido Domenico, and a virgin named Isabella
Sirani, now living, who has painted many excellent
pieces, and imitates Guido so well, that many skillful
artists have been deceived.</p>

<p>At the Mendicants are the Miracles of St. Eloy, by
Reni, after the manner of Caravaggio, but better; and
here they showed us that famous piece of Christ calling
St. Matthew, by Annibal Caracci. The Marquis Magniani
has the whole frieze of his hall painted in <i>fresco</i> by
the same hand.</p>

<p>Many of the religious men nourish those lapdogs
which the ladies are so fond of, and which they here
sell. They are a pigmy sort of spaniels, whose noses they
break when puppies; which, in my opinion, deforms them.</p>

<p>At the end of the turning in one of the wings of the
dormitory of St. Michael, I found a paper pasted near
the window, containing the dimensions of most of the
famous churches in Italy compared with their towers
here, and the length of this gallery, a copy whereof I took.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>From hence being brought to a subterranean territory
of cellars, the courteous friars made us taste a variety of
excellent wines; and so we departed to our inn.</p>

<p>The city is famous also for sausages; and here is sold
great quantities of Parmegiano cheese, with Botargo,
Caviare, etc., which makes some of their shops perfume
the streets with no agreeable smell. We furnished ourselves
with wash balls, the best being made here,
and being a considerable commodity. This place has also
been celebrated for lutes made by the old masters, Mollen,
Hans Frey, and Nicholas Sconvelt, which were of extraordinary
price; the workmen were chiefly Germans. The
cattle used for draught in this country (which is very rich
and fertile, especially in pasturage) are covered with
housings of linen fringed at the bottom, that dangle about
them, preserving them from flies, which in summer are
very troublesome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FERRARA</div>

<p>From this pleasant city, we proceeded toward Ferrara,
carrying with us a bulletino, or bill of health (customary
in all these parts of Italy, especially in the State of
Venice) and so put ourselves into a boat that was towed
with horses, often interrupted by the sluices (inventions
there to raise the water for the use of mills, and to fill
the artificial canals) at each of which we stayed till
passage was made. We went by the Castle Bentivoglio,
and, about night arrived at an ugly inn called <i>Mal Albergo</i>,
agreeable to its name, whence, after we had supped,
we embarked and passed that night through the Fens,
where we were so pestered with those flying glow-worms,
called <i>Luccioli</i>, that one who had never heard of
them, would think the country full of sparks of fire.
Beating some of them down and applying them to a
book, I could read in the dark by the light they afforded.</p>

<p>Quitting our boat, we took coach, and by morning got
to Ferrara, where, before we could gain entrance, our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
guns and arms were taken from us of custom, the lock
being taken off before, as we were advised. The city is
in a low marshy country, and therefore well fortified.
The houses and streets have nothing of beauty, except
the palace and church of St. Benedict, where Ariosto lies
buried, and there are some good statues, the palazzo del
Diamante, citadel, church of St. Dominico. The market-place
is very spacious, having in its centre the figure of
Nicholao Oläo once Duke of Ferrara, on horseback, in
copper. It is, in a word, a dirty town, and, though the
streets be large they remain ill paved; yet it is a University
and now belongs to the Pope. Though there are
not many fine houses in the city, the inn where we
lodged was a very noble palace, having an Angel for its
sign.</p>



<p>We parted from hence about three in the afternoon,
and went some of our way on the canal, and then embarked
on the Po; or Padus; by the poets called Eridanus, where
they feign Phæton to have fallen after his rash attempt,
and where Io was metamorphosed into a cow. There
was in our company, among others, a Polonian Bishop,
who was exceeding civil to me in this passage, and afterward
did me many kindnesses at Venice. We supped
this night at a place called Corbua, near the ruins of the
ancient city, Adria, which gives name to the Gulf, or
Sea. After three miles, having passed thirty on the Po,
we embarked in a stout vessel, and through an artificial
canal, very straight, we entered the Adige, which carried
us by break of day into the Adriatic, and so sailing prosperously
by Chioza (a town upon an island in this sea),
and Palestina, we came over against Malamocco (the chief
port and anchorage where our English merchantmen lie
that trade to <span class="sidenote">VENICE</span>Venice) about seven at night, after we had
stayed at least two hours for permission to land, our bill
of health being delivered, according to custom. So soon
as we came on shore, we were conducted to the Dogana,
where our portmanteaus were visited, and then we got
to our lodging, which was at honest Signor Paulo Rhodomante's
at the Black Eagle, near the Rialto, one of the
best quarters of the town. This journey from Rome to
Venice cost me seven pistoles, and thirteen julios.</p>

<p>June, 1645. The next morning, finding myself extremely
weary and beaten with my journey, I went to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
one of their bagnios, where you are treated after the
eastern manner, washing with hot and cold water, with
oils, and being rubbed with a kind of strigil of seal-skin,
put on the operator's hand like a glove. This bath
did so open my pores, that it cost me one of the greatest
colds I ever had in my life, for want of necessary caution
in keeping myself warm for some time after; for, coming
out, I immediately began to visit the famous places of
the city; and travelers who come into Italy do nothing
but run up and down to see sights, and this city well
deserved our admiration, being the most wonderfully
placed of any in the world, built on so many hundred
islands, in the very sea, and at good distance from the
continent. It has no fresh water except what is reserved
in cistern from rain, and such as is daily brought from
<i>terra firma</i> in boats, yet there was no want of it, and all
sorts of excellent provisions were very cheap.</p>

<p>It is said that when the Huns overran Italy, some
mean fishermen and others left the mainland, and fled
for shelter to these despicable and muddy islands, which,
in process of time, by industry, are grown to the greatness
of one of the most considerable States, considered
as a Republic, and having now subsisted longer than any
of the four ancient Monarchies, flourishing in great state,
wealth, and glory, by the conquest of great territories in
Italy, Dacia, Greece, Candia, Rhodes, and Sclavonia, and
at present challenging the empire of all the Adriatic Sea,
which they yearly espouse by casting a gold ring
into it with great pomp and ceremony, on Ascension-day;
the desire of seeing this was one of the reasons that
hastened us from Rome.</p>

<p>The Doge, having heard mass in his robes of state
(which are very particular, after the eastern fashion),
together with the Senate in their gowns, embarked in
their gloriously painted, carved, and gilded Bucentora,
environed and followed by innumerable galleys, gondolas,
and boats, filled with spectators, some dressed in
masquerade, trumpets, music, and cannons. Having
rowed about a league into the Gulf, the Duke, at the
prow, casts a gold ring and cup into the sea, at which a
loud acclamation is echoed from the great guns of the
Arsenal, and at the Liddo. We then returned.</p>

<p>Two days after, taking a gondola, which is their water-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>coach
(for land ones, there are many old men in this
city who never saw one, or rarely a horse), we rode up
and down the channels, which answer to our streets.
These vessels are built very long and narrow, having
necks and tails of steel, somewhat spreading at the beak
like a fish's tail, and kept so exceedingly polished as to
give a great lustre; some are adorned with carving,
others lined with velvet (commonly black), with curtains
and tassels, and the seats like couches, to lie stretched
on, while he who rows, stands upright on the very edge
of the boat, and, with one oar bending forward as if he
would fall into the sea, rows and turns with incredible
dexterity; thus passing from channel to channel, landing
his fare, or patron, at what house he pleases. The beaks
of these vessels are not unlike the ancient Roman rostrums.</p>

<p>The first public building I went to see was the Rialto,
a bridge of one arch over the grand canal, so large as to
admit a galley to row under it, built of good marble,
and having on it, besides many pretty shops, three ample
and stately passages for people without any inconvenience,
the two outmost nobly balustered with the same
stone; a piece of architecture much to be admired. It
was evening, and the canal where the Noblesse go to
take the air, as in our Hyde Park, was full of ladies and
gentlemen. There are many times dangerous stops, by
reason of the multitude of gondolas ready to sink one
another; and indeed they affect to lean them on one
side, that one who is not accustomed to it, would be
afraid of over-setting. Here they were singing, playing
on harpsichords, and other music, and serenading their
mistresses; in another place, racing, and other pastimes
on the water, it being now exceeding hot.</p>

<p>Next day, I went to their Exchange, a place like ours,
frequented by merchants, but nothing so magnificent;
from thence, my guide led me to the Fondigo di Todeschi,
which is their magazine, and here many of the
merchants, especially Germans, have their lodging and
diet, as in a college. The outside of this stately fabric
is painted by Giorgione da Castelfranco, and Titian
himself.</p>

<p>Hence, I passed through the Mercera, one of the most
delicious streets in the world for the sweetness of it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and is all the way on both sides tapestried as it were
with cloth of gold, rich damasks and other silks, which
the shops expose and hang before their houses from the
first floor, and with that variety that for near half the
year spent chiefly in this city, I hardly remember to
have seen the same piece twice exposed; to this add the
perfumes, apothecaries' shops, and the innumerable cages
of nightingales which they keep, that entertain you
with their melody from shop to shop, so that shutting
your eyes, you would imagine yourself in the country,
when indeed you are in the middle of the sea. It is
almost as silent as the middle of a field, there being
neither rattling of coaches nor trampling of horses.
This street, paved with brick, and exceedingly clean,
brought us through an arch into the famous piazza of
St. Mark.</p>

<p>Over this porch stands that admirable clock, celebrated,
next to that of Strasburg, for its many movements;
among which, about twelve and six, which are their
hours of Ave Maria, when all the town are on their knees,
come forth the three Kings led by a star, and passing
by the image of Christ in his Mother's arms, do their
reverence, and enter into the clock by another door.
At the top of this turret, another automaton strikes the
quarters. An honest merchant told me that one day
walking in the piazza, he saw the fellow who kept the
clock struck with this hammer so forcibly, as he was
stooping his head near the bell, to mend something amiss
at the instant of striking, that being stunned, he reeled
over the battlements, and broke his neck. The buildings
in this piazza are all arched, on pillars, paved within
with black and white polished marble, even to the shops,
the rest of the fabric as stately as any in Europe, being
not only marble, but the architecture is of the famous
Sansovini, who lies buried in St. Jacomo, at the end of the
piazza. The battlements of this noble range of buildings,
are railed with stone, and thick-set with excellent statues,
which add a great ornament. One of the sides is yet
much more Roman-like than the other which regards the
sea, and where the church is placed. The other range
is plainly Gothic; and so we entered into St. Mark's
Church, before which stand two brass pedestals exquisitely
cast and figured, which bear as many tall masts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
painted red, on which, upon great festivals, they hang
flags and streamers. The church is also Gothic; yet for
the preciousness of the materials, being of several rich
marbles, abundance of porphyry, serpentine, etc., far exceeding
any in Rome, St. Peter's hardly excepted. I
much admired the splendid history of our blessed Savior,
composed all of Mosaic over the <i>facciata</i>, below which
and over the four chief gates are cast four horses in
copper as big as the life, the same that formerly were
transported from Rome by Constantine to Byzantium,
and thence by the Venetians hither.<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_33_33">33</a> They are supported
by eight porphyry columns, of very great size and value.
Being come into the church, you see nothing, and tread
on nothing, but what is precious. The floor is all inlaid
with agates, lazulis, chalcedons, jaspers, porphyries, and
other rich marbles, admirable also for the work; the walls
sumptuously incrusted, and presenting to the imagination
the shapes of men, birds, houses, flowers, and a thousand
varieties. The roof is of most excellent Mosaic;
but what most persons admire is the new work of the
emblematic tree at the other passage out of the church.
In the midst of this rich <i>volto</i> rise five cupolas, the middle
very large and sustained by thirty-six marble columns,
eight of which are of precious marbles: under these cupolas
is the high altar, on which is a reliquary of several
sorts of jewels, engraven with figures, after the Greek
manner, and set together with plates of pure gold. The
altar is covered with a canopy of ophite, on which is
sculptured the story of the Bible, and so on the pillars,
which are of Parian marble, that support it. Behind
these, are four other columns of transparent and true
Oriental alabaster, brought hither out of the mines of
Solomon's Temple, as they report. There are many chapels
and notable monuments of illustrious persons, dukes,
cardinals, etc., as Zeno, J. Soranzi, and others: there is
likewise a vast baptistry, of copper. Among other venerable
relics is a stone, on which they say our blessed
Lord stood preaching to those of Tyre and Sidon, and
near the door is an image of Christ, much adorned, esteeming
it very sacred, for that a rude fellow striking
it they say, there gushed out a torrent of blood. In one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of the corners lies the body of St. Isidore, brought hither
500 years since from the island of Chios. A little farther,
they show the picture of St. Dominic and Francis,
affirmed to have been made by the Abbot Joachim (many
years before any of them were born). Going out of the
church, they showed us the stone where Alexander III.
trod on the neck of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa,
pronouncing that verse of the psalm, "<i>super basiliscum</i>,"
etc. The doors of the church are of massy copper.
There are near 500 pillars in this building, most of them
porphyry and serpentine, and brought chiefly from Athens,
and other parts of Greece, formerly in their power. At
the corner of the church, are inserted into the main
wall four figures, as big as life, cut in porphyry; which
they say are the images of four brothers who poisoned
one another, by which means were escheated to the Republic
that vast treasury of relics now belonging to the
church. At the other entrance that looks toward the
sea, stands in a small chapel that statue of our Lady,
made (as they affirm) of the same stone, or rock, out of
which Moses brought water to the murmuring Israelites
at Horeb, or Meriba.</p>

<p>After all that is said, this church is, in my opinion,
much too dark and dismal, and of heavy work; the fabric,—as
is much of Venice, both for buildings and other
fashions and circumstances,—after the Greeks, their
next neighbors.</p>

<p>The next day, by favor of the French ambassador, I
had admittance with him to view the Reliquary, called
here Tesoro di San Marco, which very few, even of travelers,
are admitted to see. It is a large chamber full of
presses. There are twelve breastplates or pieces of pure
golden armor, studded with precious stones, and as many
crowns dedicated to St. Mark, by so many noble Venetians,
who had recovered their wives taken at sea by
the Saracens; many curious vases of agates; the cap, or
coronet, of the Dukes of Venice, one of which had a
ruby set on it, esteemed worth 200,000 crowns; two unicorns'
horns; numerous vases and dishes of agate, set
thick with precious stones and vast pearls; divers heads
of Saints enchased in gold; a small ampulla, or glass,
with our Savior's blood; a great morsel of the real cross;
one of the nails; a thorn; a fragment of the column to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
which our Lord was bound, when scourged; the standard
or ensign, of Constantine; a piece of St. Luke's arm; a
rib of St. Stephen; a finger of Mary Magdalen; numerous
other things, which I could not remember. But a
priest, first vesting himself in his sacerdotals, with the
stole about his neck, showed us the gospel of St. Mark
(their tutelar patron) written by his own hand, and whose
body they show buried in the church, brought hither
from Alexandria many years ago.</p>

<p>The Religious de li Servi have fine paintings of Paolo
Veronese, especially the Magdalen.</p>

<p>A French gentleman and myself went to the Courts of
Justice, the Senate House, and Ducal Palace. The first
court near this church is almost wholly built of several
colored sorts of marble, like checkerwork on the outside;
this is sustained by vast pillars, not very shapely, but
observable for their capitals, and that out of thirty-three
no two are alike. Under this fabric is the cloister where
merchants meet morning and evening, as also the grave
senators and gentlemen, to confer of state affairs, in their
gowns and caps, like so many philosophers; it is a very
noble and solemn spectacle. In another quadrangle,
stood two square columns of white marble, carved, which
they said had been erected to hang one of their Dukes
on, who designed to make himself Sovereign. Going
through a stately arch, there were standing in niches
divers statues of great value, among which is the so
celebrated Eve, esteemed worth its weight in gold; it is
just opposite to the stairs where are two Colossuses of
Mars and Neptune, by Sansovino. We went up into a
Corridor built with several Tribunals and Courts of Justice;
and by a well-contrived staircase were landed in
the Senate hall, which appears to be one of the most
noble and spacious rooms in Europe, being seventy-six
paces long, and thirty-two in breadth. At the upper end,
are the Tribunals of the Doge, Council of Ten, and
Assistants: in the body of the hall, are lower ranks of
seats, capable of containing 1,500 Senators; for they consist
of no fewer on grand debates. Over the Duke's
throne are the paintings of the Final Judgment, by
Tintoret, esteemed among the best pieces in Europe.
On the roof are the famous Acts of the Republic, painted
by several excellent masters, especially Bassano; next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
them, are the effigies of the several Dukes, with their
Elogies. Then, we turned into a great Court painted
with the Battle of Lepanto, an excellent piece; afterward,
into the Chamber of the Council of Ten, painted by the
most celebrated masters. From hence, by the special
favor of an Illustrissimo, we were carried to see the
private Armory of the Palace, and so to the same court
we first entered, nobly built of polished white marble,
part of which is the Duke's Court, <i>pro tempore</i>; there
are two wells adorned with excellent work in copper.
This led us to the seaside, where stand those columns
of ophite stone in the entire piece, of a great height,
one bearing St. Mark's Lion, the other St. Theodorus:
these pillars were brought from Greece, and set up by
Nicholas Baraterius, the architect; between them public
executions are performed.</p>

<p>Having fed our eyes with the noble prospect of the
Island of St. George, the galleys, gondolas, and other
vessels passing to and fro, we walked under the cloister
on the other side of this goodly piazza, being a most
magnificent building, the design of Sansovino. Here we
went into the <i>Zecca</i>, or mint; at the entrance, stand two
prodigious giants, or Hercules, of white <a id="tn_png_231"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a semicolon after "marble"-->marble; we saw
them melt, beat, and coin silver, gold, and copper. We
then went up into the Procuratory, and a library of
excellent MSS. and books belonging to it and the public.
After this, we climbed up the tower of St. Mark, which
we might have done on horseback, as it is said one of
the French Kings did; there being no stairs, or steps,
but returns that take up an entire square on the arches
forty feet, broad enough for a coach. This steeple stands
by itself, without any church near it, and is rather a
watch tower in the corner of the great piazza, 230 feet in
height, the foundation exceeding deep; on the top, is
an angel, that turns with the wind; and from hence is
a prospect down the Adriatic, as far as Istria and the
Dalmatian side, with the surprising sight of this miraculous
city, lying in the bosom of the sea, in the shape of
a lute, the numberless islands tacked together by no
fewer than 450 bridges. At the foot of this tower, is a
public tribunal of excellent work, in white marble
polished, adorned with several brass statues and figures of
stone and mezzo-relievo, the performance of some rare artist.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now Ascension-week, and the great mart, or fair,
of the whole year was kept, everybody at liberty and jolly;
the noblemen stalking with their ladies on <i>choppines</i>. These
are high-heeled shoes, particularly affected by these proud
dames, or, as some say, invented to keep them at home, it
being very difficult to walk with them; whence, one being
asked how he liked the Venetian dames, replied, they were
"<i>mezzo carne, mezzo legno</i>," half flesh, half wood, and he
would have none of them. The truth is, their garb is
very odd, as seeming always in masquerade; their other
habits also totally different from all nations. They wear
very long, crisp hair, of several streaks and colors, which
they make so by a wash, disheveling it on the brims of
a broad hat that has no crown, but a hole to put out their
heads by; they dry them in the sun, as one may see them
at their windows. In their tire, they set silk flowers and
sparkling stones, their petticoats coming from their very
arm-pits, so that they are near three quarters and a half
apron; their sleeves are made exceedingly wide, under
which their shift-sleeves as wide, and commonly tucked
up to the shoulder, showing their naked arms, through
false sleeves of tiffany, girt with a bracelet or two, with
knots of point richly tagged about their shoulders and
other places of their body, which they usually cover with
a kind of yellow veil of lawn, very transparent. Thus
attired, they set their hands on the heads of two matron-like
servants, or old women, to support them, who are
mumbling their beads. It is ridiculous to see how these
ladies crawl in and out of their gondolas, by reason of
their <i>choppines</i>; and what dwarfs they appear, when taken
down from their wooden scaffolds; of these I saw near
thirty together, stalking half as high again as the rest of
the world. For courtesans, or the citizens, may not wear
<i>choppines</i>, but cover their bodies and faces with a veil of
a certain glittering taffeta, or lustrée, out of which they
now and then dart a glance of their eye, the whole face
being otherwise entirely hid with it: nor may the common
misses take this habit; but go abroad barefaced.
To the corner of these virgin-veils hang broad but flat
tassels of curious Point de Venice. The married women
go in black veils. The nobility wear the same color, but
a fine cloth lined with taffeta, in summer, with fur of the
bellies of squirrels, in the winter, which all put on at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
certain day, girt with a girdle embossed with silver,
the vest not much different from what our Bachelors of
Arts wear in Oxford, and a hood of cloth, made like a
sack, cast over their left shoulder, and a round cloth black
cap fringed with wool, which is not so comely; they also
wear their collar open, to show the diamond button of the
stock of their shirt. I have never seen pearls for color and
bigness comparable to what the ladies wear, most of the
noble families being very rich in jewels, especially pearls,
which are always left to the son, or brother who is destined
to marry; which the eldest seldom do. The Doge's
vest is of crimson velvet, the Procurator's, etc. of damask,
very stately. Nor was I less surprised with the strange
variety of the several nations seen every day in the streets
and piazzas; Jews, Turks, Armenians, Persians, Moors,
Greeks, Sclavonians, some with their targets and bucklers,
and all in their native fashions, negotiating in this
famous Emporium, which is always crowded with strangers.</p>

<p>This night, having with my Lord Bruce taken our
places before we went to the Opera, where comedies and
other plays are represented in recitative music, by the
most excellent musicians, vocal and instrumental, with
variety of scenes painted and contrived with no less art
of perspective, and machines for flying in the air, and
other wonderful notions; taken together, it is one of the
most magnificent and expensive diversions the wit of man
can invent. The history was, Hercules in Lydia; the
scenes changed thirteen times. The famous voices, Anna
Rencia, a Roman, and reputed the best treble of women;
but there was an eunuch who, in my opinion, surpassed
her; also a Genoese that sung an incomparable bass. This
held us by the eyes and ears till two in the morning,
when we went to the Chetto de san Felice, to see the
noblemen and their ladies at basset, a game at cards
which is much used; but they play not in public, and all
that have inclination to it are in masquerade, without
speaking one word, and so they come in, play, lose or
gain, and go away as they please. This time of license
is only in carnival and this Ascension-week; neither are
their theatres open for that other magnificence, or for
ordinary comedians, save on these solemnities, they being
a frugal and wise people, and exact observers of all
sumptuary laws.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>There being at this time a ship bound for the Holy
Land, I had resolved to embark, intending to see Jerusalem,
and other parts of Syria, Egypt and Turkey; but
after I had provided all necessaries, laid in snow to cool
our drink, bought some sheep, poultry, biscuit, spirits,
and a little cabinet of drugs in case of sickness, our vessel
(whereof Captain Powell was master), happened to be
pressed for the service of the State, to carry provisions to
Candia, now newly attacked by the Turks; which altogether
frustrated my design, to my great mortification.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PADUA</div>

<p>On the ... of June, we went to Padua, to the fair of
their St. Anthony, in company of divers passengers.
The first <i>terra firma</i> we landed at was Fusina, being
only an inn where we changed our barge, and were then
drawn up by horses through the river Brenta, a straight
channel as even as a line for twenty miles, the country
on both sides deliciously adorned with country villas and
gentlemen's retirements, gardens planted with oranges,
figs, and other fruit, belonging to the Venetians. At
one of these villas we went ashore to see a pretty contrived
palace. Observable in this passage was buying
their water of those who farm the sluices; for this artificial
river is in some places so shallow, that reserves of
water are kept with sluices, which they open and shut
with a most ingenious invention, or engine, governed
even by a child. Thus they keep up the water, or let
it go, till the next channel be either filled by the stop,
or abated to the level of the other; for which every boat
pays a certain duty. Thus, we stayed near half an hour
and more, at three several places, so as it was evening
before we got to Padua. This is a very ancient city, if
the tradition of Antenor's, being the founder, be not a
fiction; but thus speaks the inscription over a stately
gate:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Hanc antiquissimam urbem literarum omnium asylum, cujus
agrum fertilitatis Lumen Natura esse voluit, Antenor condidit,
anno ante Christum natum M. Cxviii; Senatus autem Venetus his
belli propugnaculis ornavit.</i>"</p>

<p>The town stands on the river Padus, whence its name,
and is generally built like Bologna, on arches and on
brick, so that one may walk all around it, dry, and in
the shade; which is very convenient in these hot countries,
and I think I was never sensible of so burning a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
heat as I was this season, especially the next day, which
was that of the fair, filled with noble Venetians, by
reason of a great and solemn procession to their famous
cathedral. Passing by St. Lorenzo, I met with this
subscription:</p>

<div class="centerpoem">
<div class="poem">
<span class="ia">"<i>Inclytus Antenor patriam vox nisa quietem</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Transtulit huc Henetum Dardanidumq; fuga,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Expulit Euganeos, Patavinam condidit urbem,</i><br></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Quem tegit hic humili marmore cæsa domus.</i>"</span>
</div></div>

<p>Under the tomb, was a cobbler at his work. Being
now come to St. Antony's (the street most of the way
straight, well built, and outside excellently painted in
<i>fresco</i>), we surveyed the spacious piazza, in which is
erected a noble statue of copper of a man on horseback,
in memory of one Catta Malata, a renowned captain.
The church, <i>à la Greca</i>, consists of five handsome
cupolas, leaded. At the left hand within is the tomb of St.
Antony and his altar, about which a mezzo-relievo of
the miracles ascribed to him is exquisitely wrought in
white marble by the three famous sculptors, Tullius
Lombardus, Jacobus Sansovinus, and Hieronymus Compagno.
A little higher is the choir, walled parapet-fashion,
with sundry colored stone, half relievo, the work
of Andrea Reccij. The altar within is of the same
metal, which, with the candlestick and bases, is, in my
opinion, as magnificent as any in Italy. The wainscot
of the choir is rarely inlaid and carved. Here are the
sepulchres of many famous persons, as of Rodolphus
Fulgosi, etc.; and among the rest, one for an exploit at
sea, has a galley exquisitely carved thereon. The procession
bore the banners with all the treasure of the
cloister, which was a very fine sight.</p>

<p>Hence, walking over the Prato delle Valle, I went to
see the convent of St. Justina, than which I never beheld
one more magnificent. The church is an excellent
piece of architecture, of Andrea Palladio, richly paved,
with a stately cupola that covers the high altar enshrining
the ashes of that saint. It is of <i>pietra-commessa</i>, consisting
of flowers very naturally done. The choir is inlaid
with several sorts of wood representing the holy history,
finished with exceeding industry. At the far end, is that
rare painting of St. Justina's Martyrdom, by Paolo Veronese;
and a stone on which they told us divers primitive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Christians had been decapitated. In another place (to
which leads a small cloister well painted) is a dry well,
covered with a brass-work grate, wherein are the bones
of divers martyrs. They show also the bones of St. Luke,
in an old alabaster coffin; three of the Holy Innocents;
and the bodies of St. Maximus and Prosdocimus.<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_34_34">34</a> The
dormitory above is exceedingly commodious and stately;
but what most pleased me, was the old cloister so well
painted with the legendary saints, mingled with many
ancient inscriptions, and pieces of urns dug up, it seems,
at the foundation of the church. Thus, having spent
the day in rambles, I returned the next day to Venice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VENICE</div>

<p>The arsenal is thought to be one of the best furnished
in the world. We entered by a strong port, always
guarded, and, ascending a spacious gallery, saw arms of
back, breast, and head, for many thousands; in another
were saddles; over them, ensigns taken from the Turks.
Another hall is for the meeting of the Senate; passing a
graff, are the smiths' forges, where they are continually
employed on anchors and iron work. Near it is a well
of fresh water, which they impute to two rhinoceros's
horns which they say lie in it, and will preserve it from
ever being empoisoned. Then we came to where the carpenters
were building their magazines of oars, masts, etc.,
for an hundred galleys and ships, which have all their
apparel and furniture near them. Then the foundry,
where they cast ordnance; the forge is 450 paces long,
and one of them has thirteen furnaces. There is one
cannon, weighing 16,573 pounds, cast while Henry the
Third dined, and put into a galley built, rigged, and
fitted for launching within that time. They have also
arms for twelve galeasses, which are vessels to row, of
almost 150 feet long, and thirty wide, not counting prow
or poop, and contain twenty-eight banks of oars, each
seven men, and to carry 1,300 men, with three masts.
In another, a magazine for fifty galleys, and place for
some hundreds more. Here stands the Bucentaur, with
a most ample deck, and so contrived that the slaves are
not seen, having on the poop a throne for the Doge to
sit, when he goes in triumph to espouse the Adriatic.
Here is also a gallery of 200 yards long for cables, and
above that a magazine of hemp. Opposite these, are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
saltpetre houses, and a large row of cells, or houses, to
protect their galleys from the weather. Over the gate,
as we go out, is a room full of great and small guns,
some of which discharge six times at once. Then, there
is a court full of cannon, bullets, chains, grapples, grenadoes,
etc., and over that arms for 800,000 men, and by
themselves arms for 400, taken from some that were in
a plot against the state; together with weapons of offense
and defense for sixty-two ships; thirty-two pieces of ordnance,
on carriages taken from the Turks, and one prodigious
mortar-piece. In a word, it is not to be reckoned
up what this large place contains of this sort. There
were now twenty-three galleys, and four galley-grossi, of
100 oars to a side. The whole arsenal is walled about,
and may be in compass about three miles, with twelve
towers for the watch, besides that the sea environs it.
The workmen, who are ordinarily 500, march out in
military order, and every evening receive their pay
through a small hole in the gate where the governor
lives.</p>



<p>The next day, I saw a wretch executed, who had murdered
his master, for which he had his head chopped off
by an ax that slid down a frame of timber, between the
two tall columns in St. Mark's piazza, at the sea-brink;
the executioner striking on the ax with a beetle; and
so the head fell off the block.</p>

<p>Hence, by Gudala, we went to see Grimani's Palace,
the portico whereof is excellent work. Indeed, the world
cannot show a city of more stately buildings, considering
the extent of it, all of square stone, and as chargeable
in their foundations as superstructure, being all built on
piles at an immense cost. We returned home by the
church of St. Johanne and Paulo, before which is, in
copper, the statue of Bartolomeo Colone, on horseback,
double gilt, on a stately pedestal, the work of Andrea
Verrochio, a Florentine. This is a very fine church, and
has in it many rare altarpieces of the best masters, especially
that on the left hand, of the Two Friars slain,
which is of Titian.</p>

<p>The day after, being Sunday, I went over to St.
George's to the ceremony of the schismatic Greeks, who
are permitted to have their church, though they are at
defiance with Rome. They allow no carved images, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
many painted, especially the story of their patron and
his dragon. Their rites differ not much from the Latins,
save that of communicating in both species, and distribution
of the holy bread. We afterward fell into a dispute
with a Candiot, concerning the procession of the
Holy Ghost. The church is a noble fabric.</p>

<p>The church of St. Zachary is a Greek building, by Leo
IV., Emperor, and has in it the bones of that prophet,
with divers other saints. Near this, we visited St. Luke's,
famous for the tomb of Aretin.</p>

<p>Tuesday, we visited several other churches, as Santa
Maria, newly incrusted with marble on the outside, and
adorned with porphyry, ophite, and Spartan stone. Near
the altar and under the organ, are sculptures, that are
said to be of the famous artist Praxiteles. To that of
St. Paul I went purposely, to see the tomb of Titian.
Then to St. John the Evangelist, where among other
heroes, lies Andrea Baldarius, the inventor of oars applied
to great vessels for fighting.</p>

<p>We also saw St. Roche, the roof whereof is, with the
school, or hall, of that rich confraternity, admirably
painted by Tintoretto, especially the Crucifix in the
<i>sacristia</i>. We saw also the church of St. Sebastian, and
Carmelites' monastery.</p>

<p>Next day, taking our gondola at St. Mark's, I passed
to the island of St. George Maggiore, where is a Convent
of Benedictines, and a well-built church of Andrea
Palladio, the great architect. The pavement, cupola,
choir, and pictures, very rich and sumptuous. The
cloister has a fine garden to it, which is a rare thing at
Venice, though this is an island a little distant from the
city; it has also an olive orchard, all environed by the
sea. The new cloister now building has a noble staircase
paved with white and black marble.</p>

<p>From hence, we visited St. Spirito, and St. Laurence,
fair churches in several islands; but most remarkable is
that of the Padri Olivetani, in St. Helen's island, for the
rare paintings and carvings, with inlaid work, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PADUA</div>

<p>The next morning, we went again to Padua, where,
on the following day, we visited the market, which is
plentifully furnished, and exceedingly cheap. Here we
saw the great hall, built in a spacious piazza, and one of
the most magnificent in Europe; its ascent is by steps a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
good height, of a reddish marble polished, much used in
these parts, and happily found not far off; it is almost
200 paces long, and forty in breadth, all covered with
lead, without any support of columns. At the further end
stands the bust, in white marble, of Titus Livius, the
historian. In this town is the house wherein he was born,
full of inscriptions, and pretty fair.</p>

<p>Near to the monument of Speron Speroni, is painted
on the ceiling the celestial zodiac, and other astronomical
figures; without side, there is a corridor, in manner of
a balcony, of the same stone; and at the entry of each
of the three gates is the head of some famous person,
as Albert Eremitano, Julio Paullo (lawyers), and Peter
Aponius. In the piazza is the Podesta's and Capitano
Grande's Palace, well built; but above all, the Monte
Pietà, the front whereof is of most excellent architecture.
This is a foundation of which there is one in most
of the cities in Italy, where there is a continual bank
of money to assist the poorer sort, on any pawn, and at
reasonable interest, together with magazines for deposit of
goods, till redeemed.</p>

<p>Hence, to the Schools of this flourishing and ancient
University, especially for the study of physic and anatomy.
They are fairly built in quadrangle, with cloisters beneath,
and above with columns. Over the great gate are the
arms of the Venetian State, and under the lion of St.
Mark.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Sic ingredere, ut teipso quotidie doctior; sic egredere ut indies
Patriæ Christianæq; Republicæ utilior evadas; ita demùm Gymnasium
à te felicitèr se ornatum existimabit.</i></p>

<p class="centerquot" style="font-size:.7em;">CIC.IX.</p>

<p>About the court walls, are carved in stone and painted
the blazons of the Consuls of all the nations, that from
time to time have had that charge and honor in the
University, which at my being there was my worthy friend
Dr. Rogers, who here took that degree.</p>

<p>The Schools for the lectures of the several sciences are
above, but none of them comparable, or so much frequented,
as the theater for anatomy, which is excellently
contrived both for the dissector and spectators. I was
this day invited to dinner, and in the afternoon (30th
July) received my <i>matricula</i>, being resolved to spend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
some months here at study, especially physic and anatomy,
of both which there were now the most famous professors
in Europe. My <i>matricula</i> contained a clause, that I, my
goods, servants, and messengers, should be free from all
tolls and reprises, and that we might come, pass, return,
buy, or sell, without any toll, etc.</p>

<p>The next morning, I saw the garden of simples, rarely
furnished with plants, and gave order to the gardener to
make me a collection of them for an <i>hortus hyemalis</i>, by
permission of the Cavalier Dr. Veslingius, then Prefect
and Botanic Professor as well as of Anatomy.</p>

<p>This morning, the Earl of Arundel,<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_35_35">35</a> now in this city, a
famous collector of paintings and antiquities, invited me
to go with him to see the garden of Mantua, where, as
one enters, stands a huge <i>colosse</i> of Hercules. From
hence to a place where was a room covered with a noble
cupola, built purposely for music; the fillings up, or cove,
between the walls, were of urns and earthen pots, for the
better sounding; it was also well painted. After dinner,
we walked to the Palace of Foscari all' Arena, there remaining
yet some appearances of an ancient theater,
though serving now for a court only before the house.
There were now kept in it two eagles, a crane, a Mauritanian
sheep, a stag, and sundry fowls, as in a vivary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VENICE</div>

<p>Three days after, I returned to Venice, and passed over
to Murano, famous for the best glasses in the world,
where having viewed their furnaces, and seen their work,
I made a collection of divers curiosities and glasses, which
I sent for England by long sea. It is the white flints
they have from Pavia, which they pound and sift exceedingly
small, and mix with ashes made of a seaweed
brought out of Syria, and a white sand, that causes this
manufacture to excel. The town is a Podestaria by itself,
at some miles distant on the sea from Venice, and
like it, built on several small islands. In this place, are
excellent oysters, small and well tasted like our Colchester,
and they were the first, as I remember, that I ever
could eat; for I had naturally an aversion to them.</p>

<p>At our return to Venice, we met several gondolas full
of Venetian ladies, who come thus far in fine weather to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
take the air, with music and other refreshments. Besides
that, Murano is itself a very nobly built town, and has
divers noblemen's palaces in it, and handsome gardens.</p>

<p>In coming back, we saw the islands of St. Christopher
and St. Michael, the last of which has a church enriched
and incrusted with marbles and other architectonic ornaments,
which the monks very courteously showed us. It
was built and founded by Margaret Emiliana of Verona,
a famous courtesan, who purchased a great estate, and
by this foundation hoped to commute for her sins. We
then rowed by the isles of St. Nicholas, whose church,
with the monuments of the Justinian family, entertained
us awhile; and then got home.</p>

<p>The next morning, Captain Powell, in whose ship I
was to embark toward Turkey, invited me on board,
lying about ten miles from Venice, where we had a dinner
of English powdered beef and other good meat, with
store of wine and great guns, as the manner is. After
dinner, the Captain presented me with a stone he had
lately brought from Grand Cairo, which he took from the
mummy-pits, full of hieroglyphics; I drew it on paper
with the true dimensions, and sent it in a letter to Mr.
Henshaw to communicate to Father Kircher, who was
then setting forth his great work "Obeliscus Pamphilius,"
where it is described, but without mentioning my name.
The stone was afterward brought for me into England,
and landed at Wapping, where, before I could hear of it,
it was broken into several fragments, and utterly defaced,
to my no small disappointment.</p>

<p>The boatswain of the ship also gave me a hand and
foot of a mummy, the nails whereof had been overlaid
with thin plates of gold, and the whole body was perfect,
when he brought it out of Egypt; but the avarice
of the ship's crew broke it to pieces, and divided the
body among them. He presented me also with two
Egyptian idols, and some loaves of the bread which the
Coptics use in the Holy Sacrament, with other curiosities.</p>
