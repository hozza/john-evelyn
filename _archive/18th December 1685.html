<p>I dined at the great entertainment
his Majesty gave the Venetian Ambassadors, Signors
Zenno and Justiniani, accompanied with ten more
noble Venetians of their most illustrious families, Cornaro,
Maccenigo, etc., who came to congratulate their
Majesties coming to the Crown. The dinner was most
magnificent and plentiful, at four tables, with music,
kettledrums, and trumpets, which sounded upon a whistle
at every health. The banquet [dessert] was twelve vast
chargers piled up so high that those who sat one against
another could hardly see each other. Of these sweetmeats,
which doubtless were some days piling up in that
exquisite manner, the Ambassadors touched not, but
leaving them to the spectators who came out of curiosity
to see the dinner, were exceedingly pleased to see in
what a moment of time all that curious work was demolished,
the comfitures voided, and the tables cleared.
Thus his Majesty entertained them three days, which
(for the table only) cost him Â£600, as the Clerk of the
Greencloth (Sir William Boreman) assured me. Dinner
ended, I saw their procession, or cavalcade, to Whitehall,
innumerable coaches attending. The two Ambassadors
had four coaches of their own, and fifty footmen
(as I remember), besides other equipage as splendid as
the occasion would permit, the Court being still in
mourning. Thence, I went to the audience which they
had in the Queen's presence chamber, the Banqueting
House being full of goods and furniture till the galleries
on the garden-side, council chamber, and new chapel,
now in the building, were finished. They went to their
audience in those plain black gowns and caps which they
constantly wear in the city of Venice. I was invited to
have accompanied the two Ambassadors in their coach to
supper that night, returning now to their own lodgings,
as no longer at the King's expense; but, being weary, I
excused myself.</p>
