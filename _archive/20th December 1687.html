<p>I went with my Lord Chief-Justice
Herbert, to see his house at Walton-on-Thames: it
is a barren place. To a very ordinary house he had
built a very handsome library, designing more building
to it than the place deserves, in my opinion. He desired
my advice about laying out his gardens, etc. The next
day, we went to Weybridge, to see some pictures of the
Duchess of Norfolk's, particularly the statue, or child in
gremio, said to be of Michael Angelo; but there are reasons
to think it rather a copy, from some proportion in
the figures ill taken. It was now exposed to sale.</p>

<p>12th January, 1687-88. Mr. Slingsby, Master of the
Mint, being under very deplorable circumstances on account
of his creditors, and especially the King, I did my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
endeavor with the Lords of the Treasury to be favorable
to him.</p>

<p>My Lord Arran, eldest son to the Duke of Hamilton,
being now married to Lady Ann Spencer, eldest daughter
of the Earl of Sunderland, Lord President of the Council,
I and my family had most glorious favors sent
us, the wedding being celebrated with extraordinary
splendor.</p>
