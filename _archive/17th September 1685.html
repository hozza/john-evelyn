<p>Early next morning, we went
to Portsmouth, something before his Majesty arrived.
We found all the road full of people, the women in their
best dress, in expectation of seeing the King pass by,
which he did, riding on horseback a good part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
way. The Mayor and Aldermen with their mace, and in
their formalities, were standing at the entrance of the
fort, a mile on this side of the town, where the Mayor
made a speech to the King, and then the guns of the
fort were fired, as were those of the garrison, as soon as
the King was come into Portsmouth. All the soldiers
(near 3,000) were drawn up, and lining the streets and
platform to God's House (the name of the Governor's residence),
where, after he had viewed the new fortifications
and shipyard, his Majesty was entertained at a magnificent
dinner by Sir ... Slingsby, the Lieutenant
Governor, all the gentlemen in his train sitting down at
table with him, which I also had done, had I not been
before engaged to Sir Robert Holmes, Governor of the
Isle of Wight, to dine with him at a private house, where
likewise we had a very sumptuous and plentiful repast of
excellent venison, fowl, fish, and fruit.</p>

<p>After dinner, I went to wait on his Majesty again, who
was pulling on his boots in the Town Hall adjoining the
house where he dined, and then having saluted some
ladies, who came to kiss his hand, he took horse
for Winchester, whither he returned that night. This
hall is artificially hung round with arms of all sorts,
like the hall and keep at Windsor. Hence, to see
the shipyard and dock, the fortifications, and other
things.</p>

<p>Portsmouth, when finished, will be very strong, and a
noble quay. There were now thirty-two men-of-war in
the harbor. I was invited by Sir R.Â Beach, the Commissioner,
where, after a great supper, Mr. Secretary and
myself lay that night, and the next morning set out for
Guildford, where we arrived in good hour, and so the
day after to London.</p>

<p>I had twice before been at Portsmouth, the Isle of
Wight, etc., many years since. I found this part of
Hampshire bravely wooded, especially about the house
and estate of Colonel Norton, who though now in being,
having formerly made his peace by means of Colonel
Legg, was formerly a very fierce commander in the first
Rebellion. His house is large, and standing low, on the
road from Winchester to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>By what I observed in this journey, is that infinite industry,
sedulity, gravity, and great understanding and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
experience of affairs, in his Majesty, that I cannot but
predict much happiness to the nation, as to its political
government; and, if he so persist, there could be nothing
more desired to accomplish our prosperity, but that he was
of the national religion.</p>
