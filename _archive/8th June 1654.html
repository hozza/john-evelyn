<p>My wife and I set out in a coach and
four horses, in our way to visit relations of hers in Wiltshire,
and other parts, where we resolved to spend some
months. We dined at Windsor, saw the Castle and Chapel
of St. George, where they have laid our blessed Martyr,
King Charles, in the <span style="font-size:.8em;">VAULT JUST BEFORE THE ALTAR</span>. The
church and workmanship in stone is admirable. The
Castle itself is large in circumference; but the rooms
melancholy, and of ancient magnificence. The keep, or
mount, hath, besides its incomparable prospect, a very
profound well; and the terrace toward Eton, with the park,
meandering Thames, and sweet meadows, yield one of the
most <a id="tn_png_320"></a><!--TN: "delighful" changed to "delightful"-->delightful prospects. That night, we lay at Reading.
Saw my Lord Craven's house at Causam [Caversham],
now in ruins, his goodly woods felling by the Rebels.</p>
