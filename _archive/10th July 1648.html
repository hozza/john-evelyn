<p>News was brought me of my Lord
Francis Villiers being slain by the rebels near Kingston.</p>

<p>16th <a id="tn_png_274"></a><!--TN: Comma added after "August"-->August, 1648. I went to Woodcote (in Epsom) to
the wedding of my brother, Richard, who married the
daughter and coheir of Esquire Minn, lately deceased;
by which he had a great estate both in land and money
on the death of a brother. The coach in which the bride
and bridegroom were, was overturned in coming home;
but no harm was done.</p>
