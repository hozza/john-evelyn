<p>I dined at my Lord Mayor's,
being desired by the Countess of Sunderland to carry
her thither on a solemn day, that she might see the
pomp and ceremony of this Prince of Citizens, there
never having been any, who for the stateliness of his
palace, prodigious feasting, and magnificence, exceeded
him. This Lord Mayor's acquaintance had been from the
time of his being apprentice to one Mr. Abbot, his uncle,
who being a scrivener, and an honest worthy man, one
who was condemned to die at the beginning of the troubles
forty years past, as concerned in the commission of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
array for King Charles I. had escaped with his life; I often
used his assistance in money matters. Robert Clayton,
then a boy, his nephew, became, after his uncle Abbot's
death, so prodigiously rich and opulent, that he was reckoned
one of the wealthiest citizens. He married a free-hearted
woman, who became his hospitable disposition;
and having no children, with the accession of his partner
and fellow apprentice, who also left him his estate, he
grew excessively rich. He was a discreet magistrate,
and though envied, I think without much cause. Some
believed him guilty of hard dealing, especially with the
Duke of Buckingham, much of whose estate he had swallowed,
but I never saw any ill by him, considering the
trade he was of. The reputation and known integrity
of his uncle, Abbot, brought all the royal party to
him, by which he got not only great credit, but vast
wealth, so as he passed this office with infinite magnificence
and honor.</p>
