<p>News was brought me that Lady
Cotton, my brother George's wife was delivered of a son.</p>

<p>I was moved by a letter out of France to publish the
letter which some time since I sent to Dean Cosin's proselyted
son; but I did not conceive it convenient, for
fear of displeasing her Majesty, the Queen.</p>
