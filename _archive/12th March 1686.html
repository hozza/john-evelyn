<p>A docket was to be sealed, importing
a lease of twenty-one years to one Hall, who styled
himself his Majesty's printer (he lately turned Papist)
for the printing missals, offices, lives of saints, portals,
primers, etc., books expressly forbidden to be printed or
sold, by divers Acts of Parliament; I refused to put my
seal to it, making my exceptions, so it was laid by.</p>
