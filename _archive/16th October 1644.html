<p>We got to anchor under the Pharos,
or watch-tower, built on a high rock at the mouth of the
Mole of Genoa, the weather being still so foul that for
two hours at least we durst not stand into the haven.
Toward evening we adventured, and came on shore by
the Prattique-house, where, after strict examination by
the Syndics, we were had to the Ducal Palace, and there
our names being taken, we were conducted to our inn,
kept by one Zacharias, an Englishman. I shall never
forget a story of our host Zachary, who, on the relation
of our peril, told us another of his own, being shipwrecked,
as he affirmed solemnly, in the middle of a great
sea somewhere in the West Indies, that he swam no less
than twenty-two leagues to another island, with a tinderbox
wrapped up in his hair, which was not so much as
wet all the way; that picking up the carpenter's tools
with other provisions in a chest, he and the carpenter,
who accompanied him (good swimmers it seems both),
floated the chest before them; and, arriving at last in a
place full of wood, they built another vessel, and so
escaped! After this story, we no more talked of our
danger; Zachary put us quite down.</p>
