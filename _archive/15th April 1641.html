<p>I repaired to London to hear and see
the famous trial of the Earl of Strafford, Lord-Deputy of
Ireland, who, on the 22d of March, had been summoned
before both Houses of Parliament, and now appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Westminster-hall,<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8_8">8</a> which was prepared with scaffolds for
the Lords and Commons, who, together with the King,
Queen, Prince, and flower of the noblesse, were spectators
and auditors of the greatest malice and the greatest
innocency that ever met before so illustrous an assembly.
It was Thomas, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl
Marshal of England, who was made High Steward upon
this occasion; and the sequel is too well known to need
any notice of the event.</p>

<p>On the 27th of April, came over out of Holland the
young Prince of Orange, with a splendid equipage, to
make love to his Majesty's eldest daughter, the now
Princess Royal.</p>

<p>That evening, was celebrated the pompous funeral of
the Duke of Richmond, who was carried in effigy, with
all the ensigns of that illustrious family, in an open
chariot, in great solemnity, through London to Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>On the 12th of May, I beheld on Tower-hill the fatal
stroke which severed the wisest head in England from
the shoulders of the Earl of Strafford, whose crime coming
under the cognizance of no human law or statute, a
new one was made, not to be a precedent, but his destruction.
With what reluctancy the King signed the
execution, he has sufficiently expressed; to which he
imputes his own unjust suffering—to such exorbitancy
were things arrived.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May, I returned to Wotton; and, on the
28th of June, I went to London with my sister, Jane,
and the day after sat to one Vanderborcht for my picture
in oil, at Arundel-house, whose servant that excellent
painter was, brought out of Germany when the Earl
returned from Vienna (whither he was sent Ambassador-extraordinary,
with great pomp and charge, though with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>out
any effect, through the artifice of the Jesuited Spaniard
who governed all in that conjuncture). With Vanderborcht,
the painter, he brought over Winceslaus Hollar,
the sculptor, who engraved not only the unhappy Deputy's
trial in Westminster-hall, but his decapitation; as he did
several other historical things, then relating to the accidents
happening during the Rebellion in England, with
great skill; besides many cities, towns, and landscapes,
not only of this nation, but of foreign parts, and divers
portraits of famous persons then in being; and things
designed from the best pieces of the rare paintings and
masters of which the Earl of Arundel was possessor,
purchased and collected in his travels with incredible
expense: so as, though Hollar's were but etched in
aquafortis, I account the collection to be the most
authentic and useful extant. Hollar was the son of a
gentleman near Prague, in Bohemia, and my very good
friend, perverted at last by the Jesuits at Antwerp to
change his religion; a very honest, simple, well-meaning
man, who at last came over again into England, where
he died. We have the whole history of the king's reign,
from his trial in Westminster-hall and before, to the
restoration of King Charles II., represented in several
sculptures, with that also of Archbishop Laud, by this
indefatigable artist; besides innumerable sculptures in
the works of Dugdale, Ashmole, and other historical
and useful works. I am the more particular upon this
for the fruit of that collection, which I wish I had
entire.</p>

<p>This picture<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9_9">9</a> I presented to my sister, being at her
request, on my resolution to absent myself from this ill
face of things at home, which gave umbrage to wiser
than myself that the medal was reversing, and our calamities
but yet in their infancy: so that, on the 15th of
July, having procured a pass at the Custom-house, where
I repeated my oath of allegiance, I went from London
to Gravesend, accompanied with one Mr. Caryll, a Surrey
gentleman, and our servants, where we arrived by
six o'clock that evening, with a purpose to take the first
opportunity of a passage for Holland. But the wind as
yet not favorable, we had time to view the Block-house
of that town, which answered to another over against it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
at Tilbury, famous for the rendezvous of Queen Elizabeth,
in the year 1588, which we found stored with
twenty pieces of cannon, and other ammunition proportionable.
On the 19th of July, we made a short excursion
to Rochester, and having seen the cathedral went
to Chatham to see the Royal Sovereign, a glorious vessel
of burden lately built there, being for defense and ornament,
the richest that ever spread cloth before the wind.
She carried an hundred brass cannon, and was 1,200 tons;
a rare sailer, the work of the famous Phineas Pett, inventor
of the frigate-fashion of building, to this day
practiced. But what is to be deplored as to this vessel
is, that it cost his Majesty the affections of his subjects,
perverted by the malcontent of great ones, who took occasion
to quarrel for his having raised a very slight tax
for the building of this, and equipping the rest of the
navy, without an act of Parliament; though, by the suffrages
of the major part of the Judges the King might
legally do in times of imminent danger, of which his
Majesty was best apprised. But this not satisfying a
jealous party, it was condemned as unprecedented, and
not justifiable as to the Royal prerogative; and, accordingly,
the Judges were removed out of their places, fined,
and imprisoned.<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10_10">10</a></p>

<p>We returned again this evening, and on the 21st of July
embarked in a Dutch frigate, bound for Flushing, convoyed
and accompanied by five other stout vessels, whereof
one was a man-of-war. The next day at noon, we
landed at Flushing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DE VERE</div>

<p>Being desirous to overtake the Leagure,<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11_11">11</a> which was
then before Genep, ere the summer should be too far
spent, we went this evening from Flushing to Middleburg,
another fine town in this island, to De Vere, whence
the most ancient and illustrious Earls of Oxford derive
their family, who have spent so much blood in assisting
the state during their wars. From De Vere we passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
over many towns, houses, and ruins of demolished suburbs,
etc., which have formerly been swallowed up by
the sea; at what time no less than eight of those islands
had been irrecoverably lost.</p>

<p>The next day we arrived at Dort, the first town of
Holland, furnished with all German commodities, and especially
Rhenish wines and timber. It hath almost at
the extremity a very spacious and venerable church; a
stately senate house, wherein was holden that famous
synod against the Arminians in 1618; and in that hall
hangeth a picture of "The Passion," an exceeding rare
and much-esteemed piece.</p>

<p>From Dort, being desirous to hasten toward the army,
I took wagon this afternoon to Rotterdam, whither we
were hurried in less than an hour, though it be ten miles
distant; so furiously do those Foremen drive. I went
first to visit the great church, the Doole, the Bourse,
and the public statue of the learned Erasmus, of brass.
They showed us his house, or rather the mean cottage,
wherein he was born, over which there are extant these
lines, in capital letters:</p>


<p class="center" style="font-size:.9em;">ÆDIBUS HIS ORTUS, MUNDUM DECORAVIT ERASMUS</p>
<p class="center" style="font-size:.9em;"><a id="tn_png_044"></a><!--TN: Comma removed after "ARTIBUS" and word was moved to the start of following line-->ARTIBUS INGENIO, RELIGIONE, FIDE.</p>


<p>The 26th of July I passed by a straight and commodious
river through Delft to the Hague; in which journey I
observed divers leprous poor creatures dwelling in solitary
huts on the brink of the water, and permitted to ask the
charity of passengers, which is conveyed to them in a
floating box that they cast out.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Hague, I went first to the Queen of
Bohemia's court, where I had the honor to kiss her
Majesty's hand, and several of the Princesses', her daughters.
Prince Maurice was also there, newly come out of
Germany; and my Lord Finch, not long before fled out
of England from the fury of the Parliament. It was a
fasting day with the Queen for the unfortunate death of
her husband, and the presence chamber had been hung
with black velvet ever since his decease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NIMEGUEN</div>

<p>The 28th of July I went to Leyden; and the 29th to
Utrecht, being thirty English miles distant (as they
reckon by hours). It was now Kermas, or a fair, in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
town, the streets swarming with boors and rudeness, so
that early the next morning, having visited the ancient
Bishop's court, and the two famous churches, I satisfied
my curiosity till my return, and better leisure. We then
came to Rynen, where the Queen of Bohemia hath a neat
and well built palace, or country house, after the Italian
manner, as I remember; and so, crossing the Rhine, upon
which this villa is situated, lodged that night in a countryman's
house. The 31st to Nimeguen; and on the 2d of
August we arrived at the Leagure, where was then the
whole army encamped about Genep, a very strong castle
situated on the river Waal; but, being taken four or
five days before, we had only a sight of the demolitions.
The next Sunday was the thanksgiving sermons
performed in Colonel Goring's regiment (eldest son of
the since Earl of Norwich) by Mr. Goffe, his chaplain
(now turned Roman, and father-confessor to the Queen-mother).
The evening was spent in firing cannon and
other expressions of military triumphs.</p>

<p>Now, according to the compliment, I was received a
volunteer in the company of Captain Apsley, of whose
Captain-lieutenant, Honywood (Apsley being absent), I
received many civilities.</p>

<p>The 3d of August, at night, we rode about the lines of
circumvallation, the general being then in the field. The
next day I was accommodated with a very spacious and
commodious tent for my lodging; as before I was with a
horse, which I had at command, and a hut which during
the excessive heats was a great convenience; for the sun
piercing the canvas of the tent, it was during the day
unsufferable, and at night not seldom infested with mists
and fogs, which ascended from the river.</p>
