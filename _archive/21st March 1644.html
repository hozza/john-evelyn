<p>On Easter Monday, we dined at
Totes, a solitary inn between Rouen and Dieppe, at which
latter place we arrived. This town is situated between
two mountains, not unpleasantly, and is washed on the
north by our English seas.</p>

<p>The port is commodious; but the entrance difficult. It
has one very ample and fair street, in which is a pretty
church. The Fort Pollet consists of a strong earth-work,
and commands the haven, as on the other side does the
castle, which is also well fortified, with the citadel before
it; nor is the town itself a little strong. It abounds
with workmen, who make and sell curiosities of ivory
and tortoise-shells; and indeed whatever the East Indies
afford of cabinets, porcelain, natural and exotic rarities,
are here to be had, with abundant choice.</p>
