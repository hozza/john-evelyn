<p>Being this day in the bedchamber
of the Princess Henrietta, where were many great beauties
and noblemen, I saluted divers of my old friends
and acquaintances abroad; his Majesty carrying my wife
to salute the Queen and Princess, and then led her into
his closet, and with his own hands showed her divers
curiosities.</p>
