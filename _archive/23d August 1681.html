<p>I went to Wotton, and, on the following
day, was invited to Mr. Denzil Onslow's at his
seat at Purford, where was much company, and such an
extraordinary feast, as I had hardly seen at any country
gentleman's table. What made it more remarkable was,
that there was not anything save what his estate about
it did afford; as venison, rabbits, hares, pheasants, partridges,
pigeons, quails, poultry, all sorts of fowl in season
from his own decoy near his house, and all sorts of fresh
fish. After dinner we went to see sport at the decoy,
where I never saw so many herons.</p>

<p>The seat stands on a flat, the ground pasture, rarely
watered, and exceedingly improved since Mr. Onslow
bought it of Sir Robert Parkhurst, who spent a fair
estate. The house is timber, but commodious, and with
one ample dining-room, the hall adorned with paintings
of fowl and huntings, etc., the work of Mr. Barlow, who
is excellent in this kind from the life.</p>
