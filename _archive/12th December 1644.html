<p>I went again to St. Peter's to
see the chapels, churches, and grots under the whole
church (like our St. Faith's under Paul's), in which lie
interred a multitude of Saints, Martyrs, and Popes;
among them our countryman, Adrian IV., (Nicholas
Brekespere) in a chest of porphyry; Sir J. Chrysostom;
Petronella; the heads of St. James minor, St. Luke, St.
Sebastian, and our Thomas Ã  Becket; a shoulder of St.
Christopher; an arm of Joseph of Arimathea; Longinus;
besides 134 more bishops, soldiers, princes, scholars,
cardinals, kings, emperors, their wives; too long to particularize.</p>

<p>Hence we walked into the cemetery, called Campo
Santo, the earth consisting of several ship-loads of mold,
transported from Jerusalem, which consumes a carcass
in twenty-four hours. To this joins that rare hospital,
where once was Nero's circus; the next to this is the Inquisition-house
and prison, the inside whereof, I thank
God, I was not curious to see. To this joins His Holiness's
Horseguards.</p>

<p>On Christmas-eve, I went not to bed, being desirous
of seeing the many extraordinary ceremonies performed
then in their churches, at midnight masses and sermons.
I walked from church to church the whole night in admiration
at the multitude of scenes and pageantry which
the friars had with much industry and craft set out, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
catch the devout women and superstitious sort of people,
who never parted without dropping some money into a
vessel set on purpose; but especially observable was the
puppetry in the Church of the Minerva, representing the
Nativity. I thence went and heard a sermon at the Apollinare;
by which time it was morning. On Christmas-day
his Holiness sang mass, the artillery of St. Angelo
went off, and all this day was exposed the cradle of our
Lord.</p>
