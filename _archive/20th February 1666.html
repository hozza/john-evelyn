<p>To the Commissioners of the Navy
who, having seen the project of the Infirmary, encouraged
the work, and were very earnest it should be set about
immediately; but I saw no money, though a very moderate
expense would have saved thousands to his Majesty, and
been much more commodious for the cure and quartering
of our sick and wounded, than the dispersing them into
private houses, where many more chirurgeons and attendants
were necessary, and the people tempted to debauchery.</p>
