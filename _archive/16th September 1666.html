<p>I went to Greenwich Church,
where Mr. Plume preached very well from this text:
"Seeing, then, all these things shall be dissolved," <a id="tn_png_35"></a><!--TN: Period added after "etc"-->etc.:
taking occasion from the late unparalleled conflagration to
remind us how we ought to walk more holy in all manner
of conversation.</p>
