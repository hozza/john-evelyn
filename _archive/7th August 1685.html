<p>I went to see Mr. Watts, keeper of
the Apothecaries' garden of simples at Chelsea, where
there is a collection of innumerable rarities of that sort
particularly, besides many rare annuals, the tree bearing
Jesuit's bark, which had done such wonders in
quartan agues. What was very ingenious was the subterranean
heat, conveyed by a stove under the conservatory,
all vaulted with brick, so as he has the doors and
windows open in the hardest frosts, secluding only the
snow.</p>
