<p>I spent the whole afternoon in
private with the Treasurer who put into my hands those
secret pieces and transactions concerning the Dutch war,
and particularly the expedition of Bergen, in which he
had himself the chief part, and gave me instructions, till
the King arriving from Newmarket, we both went up
into his bedchamber.</p>
