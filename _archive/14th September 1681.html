<p>Dined with Sir Stephen Fox,
who proposed to me the purchasing of Chelsea College,
which his Majesty had sometime since given to our
Society, and would now purchase it again to build a
hospital; or infirmary for soldiers there, in which he
desired my assistance as one of the Council of the Royal
Society.</p>
