<p>There was no more notice taken
of Christmas-day in churches.</p>

<p>I went to London, where Dr. Wild preached the funeral
sermon of Preaching, this being the last day; after
which Cromwell's proclamation was to take place, that
none of the Church of England should dare either to
preach, or administer Sacraments, teach schools, etc., on
pain of imprisonment, or exile. So this was the most
mournful day that in my life I had seen, or the Church
of England herself, since the Reformation; to the great
rejoicing of both Papist and Presbyter.<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_54_54">54</a> So pathetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
was his discourse, that it drew many tears from the
auditory. Myself, wife, and some of our family, received
the Communion, God make me thankful, who
hath hitherto provided for us the food of our souls as
well as bodies! The Lord Jesus pity our distressed
Church, and bring back the captivity of Zion!</p>

<p>5th January, 1655-56. Came to visit me my Lord Lisle,
son to the Earl of Leicester, with Sir Charles Ouseley,
two of the Usurper's council; Mr.Â John Hervey, and
John Denham, the poet.</p>
