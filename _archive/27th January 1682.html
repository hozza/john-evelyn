<p>This evening, Sir Stephen Fox
acquainted me again with his Majesty's resolution of pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>ceeding
in the erection of a Royal Hospital for emerited
soldiers on that spot of ground which the Royal Society
had sold to his Majesty for £1,300, and that he would
settle £5,000 per annum on it, and build to the value of
£20,000 for the relief and reception of four companies,
namely, 400 men, to be as in a college, or monastery.
I was therefore desired by Sir Stephen (who had not
only the whole managing of this, but was, as I perceived,
himself to be a grand benefactor, as well it
became him who had gotten so vast an estate by the soldiers)
to assist him, and consult what method to cast it
in, as to the government. So, in his study we arranged
the governor, chaplain, steward, housekeeper, chirurgeon,
cook, butler, gardener, porter, and other officers, with
their several salaries and entertainments. I would needs
have a library, and mentioned several books, since some
soldiers might possibly be studious, when they were at
leisure to recollect. Thus we made the first calculations,
and set down our thoughts to be considered and digested
better, to show his Majesty and the Archbishop. He
also engaged me to consider of what laws and orders
were fit for the government, which was to be in every
respect as strict as in any religious convent.</p>

<p>After supper, came in the famous treble, Mr. Abel,
newly returned from Italy; I never heard a more excellent
voice; one would have sworn it had been a woman's,
it was so high, and so well and skillfully managed, being
accompanied by Signor Francesco on the harpsichord.</p>
