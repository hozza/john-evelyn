<p>We set out toward Worcester, by a
way thickly planted with cider fruit. We deviated to the
Holy Wells, trickling out of a valley through a steep
declivity toward the foot of the great Malvern Hills;
they are said to heal many infirmities, as king's evil,
leprosy, sore eyes, etc. Ascending a great height above
them to the trench dividing England from South Wales,
we had the prospect of all Herefordshire, Radnor, Brecknoch,
Monmouth, Worcester, Gloucester, Shropshire, Warwick,
Derbyshires, and many more. We could discern
Tewkesbury, King's road, toward Bristol, etc.; so as I
esteem it one of the goodliest vistas in England.</p>
