<p>There being a Seal, it was feared we
should be required to pass a docket dispensing with Dr.
Obadiah Walker and four more, whereof one was an
apostate curate of Putney, the others officers of University
College, Oxford, who hold their masterships, fellowships,
and cures, and keep public schools, and enjoy all
former emoluments, notwithstanding they no more frequented
or used the public forms of prayers, or communion,
with the Church of England, or took the Test
or oaths of allegiance and supremacy, contrary to twenty
Acts of Parliament; which dispensation being also contrary
to his Majesty's own gracious declaration at the
beginning of his reign, gave umbrage (as well it might)
to every good Protestant; nor could we safely have
passed it under the Privy Seal, wherefore it was done
by immediate warrant, signed by Mr. Solicitor.</p>

<p>This Walker was a learned person, of a monkish
life, to whose tuition I had more than thirty years
since recommended the sons of my worthy friend, Mr.
Hyldyard, of Horsley in Surrey, believing him to be far
from what he proved—a hypocritical concealed Papist—by
which he perverted the eldest son of Mr. Hyldyard,
Sir Edward Hale's eldest son, and several more, to the
great disturbance of the whole nation, as well as of the
University, as by his now public defection appeared. All
engines being now at work to bring in Popery, which
God in mercy prevent!</p>

<p>This day was burned in the old Exchange, by the com<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>mon
hangman, a translation of a book written by the
famous Monsieur Claude, relating only matters of fact
concerning the horrid massacres and barbarous proceedings
of the French King against his Protestant subjects,
without any refutation of any facts therein; so mighty a
power and ascendant here had the French Ambassador,
who was doubtless in great indignation at the pious and
truly generous charity of all the nation, for the relief
of those miserable sufferers who came over for shelter.</p>

<p>About this time also, the Duke of Savoy, instigated by
the French King to extirpate the Protestants of Piedmont,
slew many thousands of those innocent people, so that
there seemed to be an universal design to destroy all
that would not go to mass, throughout Europe. <i>Quod
Avertat D. O. M.!</i> No faith in Princes!</p>
