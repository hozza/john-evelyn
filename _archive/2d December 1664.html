<p>We delivered the Privy Council's
letters to the Governors of St. Thomas's Hospital, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
Southwark, that a moiety of the house should be reserved
for such sick and wounded as should from time to time
be sent from the fleet during the war. This being delivered
at their Court, the President and several Aldermen,
Governors of that Hospital, invited us to a great
feast in Fishmongers' Hall.</p>
