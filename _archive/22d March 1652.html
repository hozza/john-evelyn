<p>I went with my brother Evelyn to
Wotton, to give him what directions I was able about
his garden, which he was now desirous to put into some
form; but for which he was to remove a mountain overgrown
with huge trees and thicket, with a moat within
ten yards of the house. This my brother immediately
attempted, and that without great cost, for more than a
hundred yards south, by digging down the mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
and flinging it into a rapid stream; it not only carried
away the sand, etc., but filled up the moat, and leveled
that noble area, where now the garden and fountain is.
The first occasion of my brother making this alteration
was my building the little retiring place between the
great wood eastward next the meadow, where, some time
after my father's death, I made a triangular pond, or
little stew, with an artificial rock after my coming out
of Flanders.</p>
