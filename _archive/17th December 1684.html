<p>Early in the morning I went
into St. James's Park to see three Turkish, or Asian
horses, newly brought over, and now first shown to his
Majesty. There were four, but one of them died at sea,
being three weeks coming from Hamburg. They
were taken from a Bashaw at the siege of Vienna, at
the late famous raising that leaguer. I never beheld
so delicate a creature as one of them was, of somewhat
a bright bay, two white feet, a blaze; such a head,
eyes, ears, neck, breast, belly, haunches, legs, pasterns,
and feet, in all regards, beautiful, and proportioned to
admiration; spirited, proud, nimble, making halt, turning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
with that swiftness, and in so small a compass, as was
admirable. With all this so gentle and tractable as
called to mind what I remember Busbequius, speaks of
them, to the reproach of our grooms in Europe, who
bring up their horses so churlishly, as makes most of
them retain their ill habits. They trotted like does, as
if they did not feel the ground. Five hundred guineas
was demanded for the first; 300 for the second; and
200 for the third, which was brown. All of them were
choicely shaped, but the two last not altogether so perfect
as the first.</p>

<p>It was judged by the spectators, among whom was the
King, Prince of Denmark, Duke of York, and several of
the Court, noble persons skilled in horses, especially Monsieur
Faubert and his son (provost masters of the Academy,
and esteemed of the best in Europe), that there
were never seen any horses in these parts to be compared
with them. Add to all this, the furniture consisting of
embroidery on the saddle, housings, quiver, bow, arrows,
scymitar, sword, mace, or battle-ax, <i>Ã  la Turcisq</i>; the
Bashaw's velvet mantle furred with the most perfect
ermine I ever beheld; all which, ironwork in common
furniture being here of silver, curiously wrought and
double gilt to an incredible value. Such and so extraordinary
was the embroidery, that I never saw anything
approaching it. The reins and headstall were of crimson
silk, covered with chains of silver gilt. There was also
a Turkish royal standard of a horse's tail, together with
all sorts of other caparisons belonging to a general's
horse, by which one may estimate how gallantly and
magnificently those infidels appear in the field; for nothing
could be seen more glorious. The gentleman (a German)
who rode the horse, was in all this garb. They were
shod with iron made round and closed at the heel, with
a hole in the middle about as wide as a shilling. The
hoofs most entire.</p>
