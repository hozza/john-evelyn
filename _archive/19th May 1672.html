<p>Went to Margate; and, the following
day, was carried to see a gallant widow, brought up a
farmeress, and I think of gigantic race, rich, comely,
and exceedingly industrious. She put me in mind of
Deborah and Abigail, her house was so plentifully stored
with all manner of country provisions, all of her own
growth, and all her conveniences so substantial, neat, and
well understood; she herself so jolly and hospitable; and
her land so trim and rarely husbanded, that it struck me
with admiration at her economy.</p>

<p>This town much consists of brewers of a certain heady
ale, and they deal much in malt, etc. For the rest, it is
raggedly built, and has an ill haven, with a small fort of
little concernment, nor is the island well disciplined; but
as to the husbandry and rural part, far exceeding any
part of England for the accurate culture of their ground,
in which they exceed, even to curiosity and emulation.</p>

<p>We passed by Rickborough, and in sight of Reculvers,
and so through a sweet garden, as it were, to Canterbury.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
