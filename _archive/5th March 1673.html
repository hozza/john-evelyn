<p>Our new vicar, Mr. Holden, preached
in Whitehall chapel, on <a id="tn_png_100"></a><!--TN: Comma removed after "Psalm"-->Psalm iv. 6, 7. This gentleman
is a very excellent and universal scholar, a good
and wise man; but he had not the popular way of
preaching, nor is in any measure fit for our plain and
vulgar auditory, as his predecessor was. There was,
however, no comparison between their parts for profound
learning. But time and experience may form him
to a more practical way than that he is in of University
lectures and erudition; which is now universally left
off for what is much more profitable.</p>
