<p>My daughter Susanna was married to
William Draper, Esq., in the chapel of Ely House, by
Dr. Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln (since Archbishop). I
gave her in portion £4,000, her jointure is £500 per
annum. I pray Almighty God to give his blessing to
this marriage! She is a good child, religious, discreet,
ingenious, and qualified with all the ornaments of her
sex. She has a peculiar talent in design, as painting
in oil and miniature, and an extraordinary genius for
whatever hands can do with a needle. She has the
French tongue, has read most of the Greek and Roman
authors and poets, using her talents with great modesty;
exquisitely shaped, and of an agreeable countenance.
This character is due to her, though coming from her
father. Much of this week spent in ceremonies, receiving
visits and entertaining relations, and a great part of
the next in returning visits.</p>
