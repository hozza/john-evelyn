<p>I accompanied my eldest brother, who
then quitted Oxford, into the country; and, on the 9th of
August, went to visit my friends at Lewes, whence I returned
the 12th to Wotton. On the 17th of September,
I received the blessed Sacrament at Wotton church, and
23d of October went back to Oxford.</p>
