<p>I was in Westminster Hall when Oates,
who had made such a stir in the kingdom, on his revealing
a plot of the Papists, and alarmed several Parliaments,
and had occasioned the execution of divers priests,
noblemen, etc., was tried for perjury at the King's
bench; but, being very tedious, I did not endeavor to see
the issue, considering that it would be published. Abundance
of Roman Catholics were in the hall in expectation
of the most grateful conviction and ruin of a person who
had been so obnoxious to them, and as I verily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
believe, had done much mischief and great injury to several
by his violent and ill-grounded proceedings; while he was
at first so unreasonably blown up and encouraged, that
his insolence was no longer sufferable.</p>

<p>Mr. Roger L'Estrange (a gentleman whom I had long
known, and a person of excellent parts, abating some
affectations) appearing first against the Dissenters in
several tracts, had now for some years turned his style
against those whom (by way of hateful distinction) they
called Whigs and Trimmers, under the title of "Observator,"
which came out three or four days every week, in
which sheets, under pretense to serve the Church of England,
he gave suspicion of gratifying another party, by
several passages which rather kept up animosities than
appeased them, especially now that nobody gave the
least occasion.<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_59_59">59</a></p>
