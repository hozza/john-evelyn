<p>I went to thank the Treasurer,
who was my great friend and loved me; I dined with
him and much company, and went thence to my Lord
Arlington, Secretary of State, in whose favor I likewise
was upon many occasions, though I cultivated neither of
their friendships by any mean submissions. I kissed his
Majesty's hand, on his making me one of the new-established
Council.</p>
