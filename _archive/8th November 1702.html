<p>My kinsman, John Evelyn, of
Nutfield, a young and very hopeful gentleman, and
Member of Parliament, after having come to Wotton
to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and
there died of the smallpox. He left a brother, a
commander in the army in Holland, to inherit a fair
estate.</p>

<p>Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea
and land, that there has not been so great an union in
Parliament, Court, and people, in memory of man, which
God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue! The
Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both
Houses of Parliament at St. Paul's; they were wonderfully
huzzaed in their passage, and splendidly entertained
in the city.</p>

<p>December, 1702. The expectation now is, what treasure
will be found on breaking bulk of the galleon brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
from Vigo by Sir George Rooke, which being made up
in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not begun
to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of
the Privy Council, two of the chief magistrates of the
city, and the Lord Treasurer.</p>

<p>After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on
the Earl of Marlborough, by making him a Knight of
the Garter and a Duke, for the success of but one campaign,
that he should desire £5,000 a year to be settled
on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought
a bold and unadvised request, as he had, besides his
own considerable estate, above £30,000 a year in places
and employments, with £50,000 at interest. He had
married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third
to the Earl of Bridgewater. He is a very handsome
person, well-spoken and affable, and supports his want of
acquired knowledge by keeping good company.</p>

<p>January, 1702-03. News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict
with the French fleet in the West Indies, in which
he gallantly behaved himself, and was wounded, and
would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance;
for this, two of their commanders were tried by a
Council of War, and executed;<a id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_94_94">94</a> a third was condemned
to perpetual imprisonment, loss of pay, and incapacity
to serve in future. The fourth died.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Onslow and Mr. Oglethorpe (son of the
late Sir Theo. O.) fought on occasion of some words
which passed at a committee of the House. Mr. Oglethorpe
was disarmed. The Bill against occasional conformity
was lost by one vote. Corn and provisions so
cheap that the farmers are unable to pay their rents.</p>

<p>February, 1703. A famous cause at the King's Bench
between Mr. Fenwick and his wife, which went for him
with a great estate. The Duke of Marlborough lost his
only son at Cambridge by the smallpox. A great earthquake
at Rome, etc. A famous young woman, an Italian,
was hired by our comedians to sing on the stage, dur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>ing
so many plays, for which they gave her £500;
which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above
all with such skill, that there was never any who did
anything comparable with their voices. She was to go
home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I believe
carried with her out of this vain nation above £1,000,
everybody coveting to hear her at their private houses.</p>
