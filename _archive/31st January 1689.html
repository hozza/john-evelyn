<p>At our church (the next day
being appointed a thanksgiving for deliverance by the
Prince of Orange, with prayers purposely composed),
our lecturer preached in the afternoon a very honest
sermon, showing our duty to God for the many signal
deliverances of our Church, without touching on politics.</p>
