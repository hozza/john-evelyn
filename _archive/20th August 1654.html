<p>From hence we had a most pleasant
ride over a large heath open like Salisbury Plain, to
Grantham, a pretty town, so well situated on the side of
a bottom which is large and at a distance environed
with ascending grounds, that for pleasure I consider it
comparable to most inland places of England; famous is
the steeple for the exceeding height of the shaft, which
is of stone.</p>

<p>About eighteen miles south, we pass by a noble seat,
and see Boston at a distance. Here, we came to a parish
of which the parson had tithe ale.</p>

<p>Thence through Rutland, we brought night to Horninghold,
from whence I set out on this excursion.</p>
