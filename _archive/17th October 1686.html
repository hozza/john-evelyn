<p>Dr. Patrick, Dean of Peterborough,
preached at Covent Garden Church on Ephes. v. 18, 19,
showing the custom of the primitive saints in serving
God with hymns, and their frequent use of them upon
all occasions: touching the profane way of mirth and
intemperance of this ungodly age. Afterward I visited
my Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, with whom I had long
and private discourse concerning the miserable condition
that kingdom was like to be in, if Tyrconnel's counsel
should prevail at Court.</p>
