<p>Lord Berkeley burnt Dieppe and
Havre de Grace with bombs, in revenge for the defeat at
Brest. This manner of destructive war was begun by
the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling on
the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a
more speedy end of the war; but rather to exasperate
and incite to revenge. Many executed at London for
clipping money, now done to that intolerable extent, that
there was hardly any money that was worth above half
the nominal value.</p>
