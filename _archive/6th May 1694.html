<p>This being the first Sunday in the
month, the blessed sacrament of the Lord's Supper
ought to have been celebrated at Wotton church, but in
this parish it is exceedingly neglected, so that, unless at
the four great feasts, there is no communion hereabouts;
which is a great fault both in ministers and people. I
have spoken to my brother, who is the patron, to discourse
the minister about it. Scarcely one shower has fallen
since the beginning of April.</p>
