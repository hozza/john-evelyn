<p>I was invited to the funeral of Captain
Gunman, that excellent pilot and seaman, who had
behaved himself so gallantly in the Dutch war. He died<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
of a gangrene, occasioned by his fall from the pier of
Calais. This was the Captain of the yacht carrying the
Duke (now King) to Scotland, and was accused for not
giving timely warning when she split on the sands, where
so many perished; but I am most confident he was no
ways guilty, either of negligence, or design, as he made
appear not only at the examination of the matter of fact,
but in the vindication he showed me, and which must
needs give any man of reason satisfaction. He was a
sober, frugal, cheerful, and temperate man; we have few
such seamen left.</p>
