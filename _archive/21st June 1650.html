<p>I went to see the Samaritan, or pump,
at the end of the Pont Neuf, which, though to appearance
promising no great matter, is, besides the machine,
furnished with innumerable rarities both of art and nature;
especially the costly grotto, where are the fairest
corals, growing out of the very rock, that I have seen;
also great pieces of crystals, amethysts, gold in the mine,
and other metals and marcasites, with two great conchas,
which the owner told us cost him 200 crowns at Amsterdam.
He showed us many landscapes and prospects,
very rarely painted in miniature, some with the pen and
crayon; divers antiquities and relievos of Rome; above
all, that of the inside of the amphitheater of Titus, incomparably
drawn by Monsieur St. Clere himself; two
boys and three skeletons, molded by Fiamingo; a book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of statues, with the pen made for Henry IV., rarely executed,
and by which one may discover many errors in
the <i>taille-douce</i> of Perrier, who has added divers conceits
of his own that are not in the originals. He has likewise
an infinite collection of <i>taille-douces</i>, richly bound
in morocco.</p>

<p>He led us into a stately chamber furnished to have entertained
a prince, with pictures of the greatest masters,
especially a Venus of Perino del Vaga; the Putti carved
in the chimney-piece by the Fleming; the vases of porcelain,
and many designed by Raphael; some paintings of
Poussin, and Fioravanti; antiques in brass; the looking-glass
and stands rarely carved. In a word, all was great,
choice, and magnificent, and not to be passed by as I
had often done, without the least suspicion that there
were such rare things to be seen in that place. At a
future visit, he showed a new grotto and a bathing place,
hewn through the battlements of the arches of Pont
Neuf into a wide vault at the intercolumniation, so that
the coaches and horses thundered over our heads.</p>
