<p>Came to dine with me Sir William
Fermor, of Northamptonshire, and Sir Christopher Wren,
his Majesty's architect and surveyor, now building the
Cathedral of St. Paul, and the column in memory of the
city's conflagration, and was in hand with the building of
fifty parish churches. A wonderful genius had this incomparable
person.</p>
