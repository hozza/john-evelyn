<p>At the funeral of Mr. Boyle, at
St. Martin's, Dr. Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, preached
on Eccles. ii. 26. He concluded with an eulogy due to
the deceased, who made God and religion the scope of
all his excellent talents in the knowledge of nature, and
who had arrived to so high a degree in it, accompanied
with such zeal and extraordinary piety, which he showed
in the whole course of his life, particularly in his exemplary
charity on all occasions,—that he gave £1,000
yearly to the distressed refugees of France and Ireland;
was at the charge of translating the Scriptures into the
Irish and Indian tongues, and was now promoting a
Turkish translation, as he had formerly done of Grotius
"on the Truth of the Christian Religion" into Arabic,
which he caused to be dispersed in the eastern countries;
that he had settled a fund for preachers who should
preach expressly against Atheists, Libertines, Socinians,
and Jews; that he had in his will given £8,000 to charitable
uses; but that his private charities were extraordinary.
He dilated on his learning in Hebrew and Greek,
his reading of the fathers, and solid knowledge in theology,
once deliberating about taking Holy Orders, and
that at the time of restoration of King Charles II., when
he might have made a great figure in the nation as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
secular honor and titles, his fear of not being able to
discharge so weighty a duty as the first, made him decline
that, and his humility the other. He spoke of his
civility to strangers, the great good which he did by his
experience in medicine and chemistry, and to what noble
ends he applied himself to his darling studies; the works,
both pious and useful, which he published; the exact life
he led, and the happy end he made. Something was
touched of his sister, the Lady Ranelagh, who died but
a few days before him. And truly all this was but his
due, without any grain of flattery.</p>

<p>This week a most execrable murder was committed on
Dr. Clench, father of that extraordinary learned child
whom I have before noticed. Under pretense of carrying
him in a coach to see a patient, they strangled him in it;
and, sending away the coachman under some pretense,
they left his dead body in the coach, and escaped in the
dusk of the evening.</p>
