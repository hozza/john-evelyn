<div class="sidenote">WOTTON</div>

<p><span class="firstLetter"><span>I</span></span> <span class="firstwords">was</span>
born at Wotton, in the County of Surrey, about
twenty minutes past two in the morning, being on
Tuesday the 31st and last of October, 1620, after my father
had been married about seven years,<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_4">4</a> and that my mother
had borne him three children; viz, two daughters and one
son, about the 33d year of his age, and the 23d of my
mother's.</p>



<p>My father, named Richard, was of a sanguine complexion,
mixed with a dash of choler: his hair inclining to
light, which, though exceedingly thick, became hoary by
the time he had attained to thirty years of age; it was
somewhat curled toward the extremities; his beard,
which he wore a little peaked, as the mode was, of a
brownish color, and so continued to the last, save that it
was somewhat mingled with gray hairs about his cheeks,
which, with his countenance, were clear and fresh-colored;
his eyes extraordinary quick and piercing; an ample
forehead,—in sum, a very well-composed visage and
manly aspect: for the rest, he was but low of stature,
yet very strong. He was, for his life, so exact and
temperate, that I have heard he had never been surprised
by excess, being ascetic and sparing. His wisdom
was great, and his judgment most acute; of solid discourse,
affable, humble, and in nothing affected; of a
thriving, neat, silent, and methodical genius, discreetly
severe, yet liberal upon all just occasions, both to his
children, to strangers, and servants; a lover of hospitality;
and, in brief, of a singular and Christian moderation in
all his actions; not illiterate, nor obscure, as, having continued
Justice of the Peace and of the Quorum, he
served his country as High Sheriff, being, as I take it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the last dignified with that office for Sussex and Surrey
together, the same year, before their separation. He was
yet a studious decliner of honors and titles; being already
in that esteem with his country, that they could have
added little to him besides their burden. He was a
person of that rare conversation that, upon frequent
recollection, and calling to mind passages of his life and
discourse, I could never charge him with the least passion,
or inadvertency. His estate was esteemed about
£4000 per annum, well wooded, and full of timber.</p>

<p>My mother's name was Eleanor, sole daughter and
heiress of John Standsfield, Esq., of an ancient and
honorable family (though now extinct) in Shropshire, by
his wife Eleanor Comber, of a good and well-known
house in Sussex. She was of proper personage; of a
brown complexion; her eyes and hair of a lovely black;
of constitution more inclined to a religious melancholy,
or pious sadness; of a rare memory, and most exemplary
life; for economy and prudence, esteemed one of the
most conspicuous in her country: which rendered her loss
much deplored, both by those who knew, and such as only
heard of her.</p>

<p>Thus much, in brief, touching my parents; nor was it
reasonable I should speak less of them to whom I owe
so much.</p>

<p>The place of my birth was Wotton, in the parish of
Wotton, or Blackheath, in the county of Surrey, the
then mansion-house of my father, left him by my grandfather,
afterward and now my eldest brother's. It is
situated in the most southern part of the shire; and,
though in a valley, yet really upon part of Leith Hill,
one of the most eminent in England for the prodigious
prospect to be seen from its summit, though by few
observed. From it may be discerned twelve or thirteen
counties, with part of the sea on the coast of Sussex, in
a serene day. The house is large and ancient, suitable
to those hospitable times, and so sweetly environed with
those delicious streams and venerable woods, as in the
judgment of strangers as well as Englishmen it may be
compared to one of the most pleasant seats in the
nation, and most tempting for a great person and a
wanton purse to render it conspicuous. It has rising
grounds, meadows, woods, and water, in abundance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>The distance from London little more than twenty
miles, and yet so securely placed, as if it were one hundred;
three miles from Dorking, which serves it abundantly
with provision as well of land as sea; six from
Guildford, twelve from Kingston. I will say nothing of
the air, because the pre-eminence is universally given to
Surrey, the soil being dry and sandy; but I should speak
much of the gardens, fountains, and groves that adorn
it, were they not as generally known to be among the
most natural, and (till this later and universal luxury of
the whole nation, since abounding in such expenses) the
most magnificent that England afforded; and which
indeed gave one of the first examples to that elegancy,
since so much in vogue, and followed in the managing
of their waters, and other elegancies of that nature.
Let me add, the contiguity of five or six manors, the
patronage of the livings about it, and what Themistocles
pronounced for none of the least advantages—the good
neighborhood. All which conspire here to render it an
honorable and handsome royalty, fit for the present possessor,
my worthy brother, and his noble lady, whose
constant liberality gives them title both to the place and
the affections of all that know them. Thus, with the
poet:</p>

<div class="centerpoem" style="font-style:italic;">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Nescio quâ natale solum dulcedine cunctos<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ducit, et immemores non sinit esse sui.</span>
</div></div>

<p>I had given me the name of my grandfather, my
mother's father, who, together with a sister of Sir Thomas
Evelyn, of Long Ditton, and Mr. Comber, a near relation
of my mother, were my susceptors. The solemnity (yet
upon what accident I know not, unless some indisposition
in me) was performed in the dining-room by Parson
Higham, the present incumbent of the parish, according
to the forms prescribed by the then glorious Church of
England.</p>

<p>I was now (in regard to my mother's weakness, or
rather custom of persons of quality) put to nurse to one
Peter, a neighbor's wife and tenant, of a good, comely,
brown, wholesome complexion, and in a most sweet place
toward the hills, flanked with wood and refreshed with
streams; the affection to which kind of solitude I sucked
in with my very milk. It appears, by a note of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
father's, that I sucked till 17th of January, 1622, or at
least I came not home before.<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5_5">5</a></p>

<p>1623. The very first thing that I can call to memory,
and from which time forward I began to observe, was
this year (1623) my youngest brother, being in his nurse's
arms, who, being then two days and nine months younger
than myself, was the last child of my dear parents.</p>

<p>1624. I was not initiated into any rudiments until near
four years of age, and then one Frier taught us at the
church-porch of Wotton; and I do perfectly remember
the great talk and stir about Il Conde Gondomar, now
Ambassador from Spain (for near about this time was
the match of our Prince with the Infanta proposed); and
the effects of that comet, 1618, still working in the prodigious
revolutions now beginning in Europe, especially
in Germany, whose sad commotions sprang from the
Bohemians' defection from the Emperor Matthias; upon
which quarrel the Swedes broke in, giving umbrage to
the rest of the princes, and the whole Christian world
cause to deplore it, as never since enjoying perfect tranquillity.</p>

<p>1625. I was this year (being the first of the reign of
King Charles) sent by my father to Lewes, in Sussex, to
be with my grandfather, Standsfield, with whom I passed
my childhood. This was the year in which the pestilence
was so epidemical, that there died in London 5,000 a week,
and I well remember the strict watches and examinations
upon the ways as we passed; and I was shortly after so
dangerously sick of a fever that (as I have heard) the
physicians despaired of me.</p>

<p>1626. My picture was drawn in oil by one Chanterell,
no ill painter.</p>

<p>1627. My grandfather, Standsfield, died this year, on
the 5th of February: I remember perfectly the solemnity
at his funeral. He was buried in the parish church of
All Souls, where my grandmother, his second wife, erected
him a pious monument. About this time, was the con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>secration
of the Church of South Malling, near Lewes,
by Dr. Field, Bishop of Oxford (one Mr. Coxhall preached,
who was afterward minister); the building whereof was
chiefly procured by my grandfather, who having the impropriation,
gave £20 a year out of it to this church. I
afterward sold the impropriation. I laid one of the first
stones at the building of the church.</p>

<p>1628-30. It was not till the year 1628, that I was put
to learn my Latin rudiments, and to write, of one Citolin,
a Frenchman, in Lewes. I very well remember that
general muster previous to the Isle of Rhè's expedition,
and that I was one day awakened in the morning with
the news of the Duke of Buckingham being slain by that
wretch, Felton, after our disgrace before La Rochelle.
And I now took so extraordinary a fancy to drawing and
designing, that I could never after wean my inclinations
from it, to the expense of much precious time, which
might have been more advantageously employed. I was
now put to school to one Mr. Potts, in the Cliff at Lewes,
from whom, on the 7th of January, 1630, being the day
after Epiphany, I went to the free-school at Southover,
near the town, of which one Agnes Morley had been the
foundress, and now Edward Snatt was the master, under
whom I remained till I was sent to the University.<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6_6">6</a> This
year, my grandmother (with whom I sojourned) being
married to one Mr. Newton, a learned and most religious
gentleman, we went from the Cliff to dwell at his house
in Southover. I do most perfectly remember the jubilee
which was universally expressed for the happy birth of
the Prince of Wales, 29th of May, now Charles II., our
most gracious Sovereign.</p>

<p>1631. There happened now an extraordinary dearth in
England, corn bearing an excessive price; and, in imitation
of what I had seen my father do, I began to observe
matters more punctually, which I did use to set down in
a blank almanac. The Lord of Castlehaven's arraignment
for many shameful exorbitances was now all the talk,
and the birth of the Princess Mary, afterward Princess of
Orange.</p>
