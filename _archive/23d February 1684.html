<p>I went to Sir John Chardin, who
desired my assistance for the engraving the plates, the
translation, and printing his History of that wonderful
Persian Monument near Persepolis, and other rare antiquities,
which he had caused to be drawn from the
originals in his second journey into Persia, which we now
concluded upon. Afterward, I went with Sir Christopher
Wren to Dr. Tenison, where we made the drawing and
estimate of the expense of the library, to be begun this
next spring near the Mews.</p>

<p>Great expectation of the Prince of Orange's attempts
in Holland to bring those of Amsterdam to consent to
the new levies, to which we were no friends, by a pseudo-politic
adherence to the French interest.</p>
