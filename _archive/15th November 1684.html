<p>Being the Queen's birthday,
there were fireworks on the Thames before Whitehall,
with pageants of castles, forts, and other devices of girandolas,
serpents, the King and Queen's arms and mottoes,
all represented in fire, such as had not been seen
here. But the most remarkable was the several fires and
skirmishes in the very water, which actually moved a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
long way, burning under the water, now and then appearing
above it, giving reports like muskets and cannon,
with grenades and innumerable other devices. It is said
it cost Â£1,500. It was concluded with a ball, where all
the young ladies and gallants danced in the great hall.
The court had not been seen so brave and rich in apparel
since his Majesty's Restoration.</p>
