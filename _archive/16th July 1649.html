<p>We departed from Paris, in company
with that very pleasant lady, Lady Catherine Scott, and
others. In all this journey we were greatly apprehensive
of parties, which caused us to alight often out of our
coach and walk separately on foot, with our guns on our
shoulders, in all suspected places.</p>
