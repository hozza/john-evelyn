<p>I went to Hampton Court, when the
Surrey gentlemen presented their addresses to his Majesty,
whose hand I kissed, introduced by the Duke of Albemarle.
Being at the Privy Council, I took another occasion
of discoursing with Sir Stephen Fox about his
daughter and to revive that business, and at least brought
it to this: That in case the young people liked one the
other, after four years, he first desiring to see a particular
of my Lord's present estate if I could transmit it to him
privately, he would make her portion £14,000, though to
all appearance he might likely make it £50,000 as easily,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
his eldest son having no child and growing very corpulent.</p>
