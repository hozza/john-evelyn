<p>Mr. Bentley preached Mr. Boyle's
lecture at St. Mary-le-Bow. So excellent a discourse
against the Epicurean system is not to be recapitulated
in a few words. He came to me to ask whether I
thought it should be printed, or that there was anything
in it which I desired to be altered. I took this as a
civility, and earnestly desired it should be printed, as
one of the most learned and convincing discourses I had
ever heard.</p>
