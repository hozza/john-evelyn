<p>Was launched at Deptford, that goodly
vessel, "The Charles." I was near his Majesty. She is
longer than the "Sovereign," and carries 110 brass cannon;
she was built by old Shish, a plain, honest carpenter,
master-builder of this dock, but one who can give very
little account of his art by discourse, and is hardly capable
of reading, yet of great ability in his calling. The family
have been ship carpenters in this yard above 300
years.</p>
