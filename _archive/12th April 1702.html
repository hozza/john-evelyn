<p>My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed
this life this morning after a long languishing illness,
leaving a son by my sister, and two granddaughters.
Our relation and friendship had been long and great. He
was a man of excellent parts. He died in the 84th year
of his age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and
carried down to Greenwich, put on board a ship, and
buried in the sea, between Dover and Calais, about the
Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or Wednesday
after. This occasioned much discourse, he having
no relation at all to the sea. He was a gentleman of an
ancient family in Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.
By his prudent parsimony he much improved his fortune.
He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might have
been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.</p>

<p>My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of
what he had laid out on repairs, amounting to Â£1,900.</p>
