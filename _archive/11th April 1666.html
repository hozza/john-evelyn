<p>Dr. Bathurst preached before the
King, from "I say unto you all, watch"—a seasonable and
most excellent discourse. When his Majesty came from
chapel, he called to me in the lobby, and told me he must
now have me sworn for a Justice of Peace (having long
since made me of the Commission); which I declined as
inconsistent with the other service I was engaged in, and
humbly desired to be excused. After dinner, waiting on
him, I gave him the first notice of the Spaniards referring
the umpirage of the peace between them and Portugal to
the French King, which came to me in a letter from France
before the Secretaries of State had any news of it. After
this, his Majesty again asked me if I had found out any
able person about our parts that might supply my place
of Justice of Peace (the office in the world I had most
industriously avoided, in regard of the perpetual trouble
thereof in these numerous parishes); on which I nominated
one, whom the King commanded me to give immediate
notice of to my Lord Chancellor, and I should be excused;
for which I rendered his Majesty many thanks. From
thence, I went to the Royal Society, where I was chosen
by twenty-seven voices to be one of their Council for the
ensuing year; but, upon my earnest suit in respect of my
other affairs, I got to be excused—and so home.</p>
