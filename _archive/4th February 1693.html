<p>After five days' trial and extraordinary
contest, the Lord Mohun was acquitted by the
Lords of the murder of Montford, the player, notwithstanding
the judges, from the pregnant witnesses of the
fact, had declared him guilty; but whether in commiseration
of his youth, being not eighteen years old, though
exceedingly dissolute, or upon whatever other reason, the
King himself present some part of the trial, and satisfied,
as they report, that he was culpable. 69 acquitted him,
only 14 condemned him.</p>

<p>Unheard of stories of the universal increase of witches
in New England; men, women, and children, devoting
themselves to the devil, so as to threaten the subversion
of the government.<a id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_79_79">79</a> At the same time there was a conspiracy
among the negroes in Barbadoes to murder all
their masters, discovered by overhearing a discourse of

the design. Hitherto an exceedingly mild winter. France
in the utmost misery and poverty for want of corn and
subsistence, while the ambitious King is intent to pursue
his conquests on the rest of his neighbors both by sea
and land. Our Admiral, Russell, laid aside for not pursuing
the advantage he had obtained over the French in
the past summer; three others chosen in his place. Dr.
Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury's book burned by the hangman
for an expression of the King's title by conquest, on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
complaint of Joseph How, a member of Parliament,
little better than a madman.</p>
