<p><span class="smcap">Shrove-Tuesday.</span> My son was
married to Mrs. Martha Spencer, daughter to my Lady
Stonehouse by a former gentleman, at St. Andrew's,
Holborn, by our Vicar, borrowing the church of Dr. Stillingfleet,
Dean of St. Paul's, the present incumbent. We
afterward dined at a house in Holborn; and, after the
solemnity and dancing was done, they were bedded at
Sir John Stonehouse's lodgings in Bow Street, Convent
Garden.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
