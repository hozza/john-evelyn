<p>I dined at Lord Falkland's, Treasurer
of the Navy, where after dinner we had rare music, there
being among others, Signor Pietro Reggio, and Signor
John Baptist, both famous, one for his voice, the other
for playing on the harpsichord, few if any in Europe exceeding
him. There was also a Frenchman who sung an
admirable bass.</p>
