<p>We had a most delicious journey
to Marseilles, through a country sweetly declining to the
south and Mediterranean coasts, full of vineyards and
olive-yards, orange trees, myrtles, pomegranates, and
the like sweet plantations, to which belong pleasantly-situated
villas to the number of above 1,500, built all of
freestone, and in prospect showing as if they were so
many heaps of snow dropped out of the clouds among
those perennial greens. It was almost at the shutting
of the gates that we arrived. Marseilles is on the sea-coast,
on a pleasant rising ground, well walled, with an
excellent port for ships and galleys, secured by a huge
chain of iron drawn across the harbor at pleasure; and
there is a well-fortified tower with three other forts,
especially that built on a rock; but the castle commanding
the city is that of Notre Dame de la Garde. In the
chapel hung up are divers crocodiles' skins.</p>

<p>We went then to visit the galleys, being about twenty-five
in number; the Capitaine of the Galley Royal gave
us most courteous entertainment in his cabin, the slaves
in the interim playing both loud and soft music very
rarely. Then he showed us how he commanded their
motions with a nod, and his whistle making them row
out. The spectacle was to me new and strange, to see
so many hundreds of miserably naked persons, their
heads being shaven close, and having only high red
bonnets, a pair of coarse canvas drawers, their whole
backs and legs naked, doubly chained about their middle
and legs, in couples, and made fast to their seats, and
all commanded in a trice by an imperious and cruel
seaman. One Turk among the rest he much favored,
who waited on him in his cabin, but with no other dress
than the rest, and a chain locked about his leg, but not
coupled. This galley was richly carved and gilded, and
most of the rest were very beautiful. After bestowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
something on the slaves, the capitaine sent a band of
them to give us music at dinner where we lodged. I
was amazed to contemplate how these miserable caitiffs
lie in their galley crowded together; yet there was hardly
one but had some occupation, by which, as leisure and
calms permitted, they got some little money, insomuch
as some of them have, after many years of cruel servitude,
been able to purchase their liberty. The rising-forward
and falling-back at their oar, is a miserable
spectacle, and the noise of their chains, with the roaring
of the beaten waters, has something of strange and fearful
in it to one unaccustomed to it. They are ruled and
chastised by strokes on their backs and soles of their
feet, on the least disorder, and without the least humanity,
yet are they cheerful and full of knavery.</p>

<p>After dinner, we saw the church of St. Victoire, where
is that saint's head in a shrine of silver, which weighs
600 pounds. Thence to Notre Dame, exceedingly
well built, which is the cathedral. Thence to the Duke
of Guise's Palace, the Palace of Justice, and the Maison
du Roi; but nothing is more strange than the great
number of slaves working in the streets, and carrying
burdens, with their confused noises, and jingling of
their huge chains. The chief trade of the town is in
silks and drugs out of Africa, Syria, and Egypt, and
Barbary horses, which are brought hither in great
numbers. The town is governed by four captains, has
three consuls, and one assessor, three judges royal; the
merchants have a judge for ordinary causes. Here we
bought umbrellas against the heats, and consulted of our
journey to Cannes by land, for fear of the Picaroon
Turks, who make prize of any small vessels about these
parts; we not finding a galley bound for Genoa, whither
we were designed.</p>
