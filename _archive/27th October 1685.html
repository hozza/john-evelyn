<p>I was invited to dine at Sir Stephen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Fox's with my Lord Lieutenant, where was such a dinner
for variety of all things as I had seldom seen, and it
was so for the trial of a master-cook whom Sir Stephen
had recommended to go with his Lordship into Ireland;
there were all the dainties not only of the season, but
of what art could add, venison, plain solid meat, fowl,
baked and boiled meats, banquet [dessert], in exceeding
plenty, and exquisitely dressed. There also dined my
Lord Ossory and Lady (the Duke of Beaufort's daughter),
my Lady Treasurer, Lord Cornbury, and other visitors.</p>
