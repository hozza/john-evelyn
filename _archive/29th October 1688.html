<p>Lady Sunderland acquainted me
with his Majesty's taking away the Seals from Lord
Sunderland, and of her being with the Queen to intercede
for him. It is conceived that he had of late grown
remiss in pursuing the interest of the Jesuitical counsels;
some reported one thing, some another; but there was
doubtless some secret betrayed, which time may discover.</p>

<p>There was a Council called, to which were summoned
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Judges, the Lord
Mayor, etc. The Queen Dowager, and all the ladies and
lords who were present at the Queen Consort's labor,
were to give their testimony upon oath of the Prince of
Wales's birth, recorded both at the Council Board and at
the Chancery a day or two after. This procedure was
censured by some as below his Majesty to condescend to,
on the talk of the people. It was remarkable that on
this occasion the Archbishop, Marquis of Halifax, the
Earls of Clarendon and Nottingham, refused to sit at the
Council table among Papists, and their bold telling his
Majesty that whatever was done while such sat among
them was unlawful and incurred <i>præmunire</i>;—at least,
if what I heard be true.</p>
