<p>I sealed and declared my will, and
that morning went from Paris, taking my journey through
Rouen, Dieppe, Ville-dieu, and St. Vallerie, where I
stayed one day with Mr.Â Waller, with whom I had some
affairs, and for which cause I took this circle to Calais,
where I arrived on the 11th, and that night embarking
in a packet boat, was by one o'clock got safe to Dover;
for which I heartily put up my thanks to God who had
conducted me safe to my own country, and been merciful
to me through so many aberrations. Hence, taking
post, I arrived at London the next day at evening, being
the 2d of October, new style.</p>
