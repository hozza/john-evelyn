<p>I went to London, to a court
of the East India Company on its new union, in Merchant-Taylors'
Hall, where was much disorder by reason
of the Anabaptists, who would have the adventurers
obliged only by an engagement, without swearing, that
they still might pursue their private trade; but it was
carried against them. Wednesday was fixed on for a
general court for election of officers, after a sermon and
prayers for good success. The Stock resolved on was
Â£800,000.</p>
