<p>Abundance of my French and English
friends and some Germans came to take leave of me,
and I set out in a coach for Calais, in an exceedingly hard
frost which had continued for some time. We got that
night to Beaumont; 30th, to Beauvais; 31st, we found the
ways very deep with snow, and it was exceedingly cold;
dined at Pois; lay at Pern√®e, a miserable cottage of miserable
people in a wood, wholly unfurnished, but in a little
time we had sorry beds and some provision, which they
told me they hid in the wood for fear of the frontier
enemy, the garrisons near them continually plundering
what they had. They were often infested with wolves.
I cannot remember that I ever saw more miserable
creatures.</p>
