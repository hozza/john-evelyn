<p>I went to Blackheath, to see the new
fair, being the first procured by the Lord Dartmouth.
This was the first day, pretended for the sale of cattle,
but I think in truth to enrich the new tavern at the
bowling-green, erected by Snape, his Majesty's farrier, a
man full of projects. There appeared nothing but an innumerable
assembly of drinking people from London,
peddlars, etc., and I suppose it too near London to be of
any great use to the country.</p>

<p>March was unusually hot and dry, and all April excessively
wet.</p>

<p>I planted all the out limits of the garden and long walks
with holly.<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_50_50">50</a></p>
