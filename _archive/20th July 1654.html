<p>We proceeded to Salisbury; the cathedral
I take to be the most complete piece of Gothic
work in Europe, taken in all its uniformity. The pillars,
reputed to be cast, are of stone manifestly cut out of the
quarry; most observable are those in the chapter house.
There are some remarkable monuments, particularly the
ancient Bishops, founders of the Church, Knights Templars,
the Marquis of Hertford's, the cloisters of the
palace and garden, and the great mural dial.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went to Wilton, a fine house of
the Earl of Pembroke, in which the most observable are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the dining room in the modern-built part toward the
garden, richly gilded and painted with story, by De Crete;
also some other apartments, as that of hunting landscapes,
by Pierce; some magnificent chimney-pieces, after
the best French manner; a pair of artificial winding stairs
of stone, and divers rare pictures. The garden, heretofore
esteemed the noblest in England, is a large handsome
plain, with a grotto and waterworks, which might
be made much more pleasant, were the river that passes
through cleansed and raised; for all is effected by a mere
force. It has a flower garden, not inelegant. But, after all,
that which renders the seat delightful is, its being so near
the downs and noble plains about the country contiguous
to it. The stables are well ordered and yield a graceful
front, by reason of the walks of lime trees, with the
court and fountain of the stables adorned with the CÃ¦sars'
heads.</p>

<p>We returned this evening by the plain, and fourteen-mile
race, where out of my lord's hare warren we were
entertained with a long course of a hare for near two
miles in sight. Near this, is a <i>pergola</i>, or stand, built to
view the sports; and so we came to Salisbury, and saw
the most considerable parts of the city. The market
place, with most of the streets, are watered by a quick
current and pure stream running through the middle of
them, but are negligently kept, when with a small
charge they might be purged and rendered infinitely
agreeable, and this made one of the sweetest towns, but
now the common buildings are despicable, and the streets
dirty.</p>
