where was a select company of our Society, Sir
William Petty, Dr. Gale (that learned schoolmaster of
St. Paul's), Dr. Whistler, Mr. Hill, etc. The conversation
was philosophical and cheerful, on divers considerable
questions proposed; as of the hereditary succession of
the Roman Emperors; the Pica mentioned in the preface
to our Common Prayer, which signifies only the
Greek <i>Kalendarium</i>. These were mixed with lighter
subjects.</p>
