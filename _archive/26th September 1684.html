<p>The King being returned from
Winchester, there was a numerous Court at Whitehall.</p>

<p>At this time the Earl of Rochester was removed from
the Treasury to the Presidentship of the Council; Lord
Godolphin was made first Commissioner of the Treasury in
his place, Lord Middleton (a Scot) made Secretary of
State, in the room of Lord Godolphin. These alterations
being very unexpected and mysterious, gave great occasion
of discourse.</p>

<p>There was now an Ambassador from the King of Siam,
in the East Indies, to his Majesty.</p>
