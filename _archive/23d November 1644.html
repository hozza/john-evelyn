<p>I went to the Jesuits' College
again, the front whereof gives place to few for its
architecture, most of its ornaments being of rich marble.
It has within a noble portico and court, sustained by
stately columns, as is the corridor over the portico, at
the sides of which are the schools for arts and sciences,
which are here taught as at the University. Here I heard
Father Athanasius Kircher upon a part of Euclid, which
he expounded. To this joins a glorious and ample church
for the students; a second is not fully finished; and there
are two noble libraries, where I was showed that famous
wit and historian, Famianus Strada. Hence we went to
the house of Hippolito Vitellesco (afterward bibliothecary
of the Vatican library), who showed us one of the best
collections of statues in Rome, to which he frequently
talks as if they were living, pronouncing now and then
orations, sentences, and verses, sometimes kissing and
embracing them. He has a head of Brutus scarred in
the face by order of the Senate for killing Julius;
this is much esteemed. Also a Minerva, and others of
great value. This gentleman not long since purchased
land in the kingdom of Naples, in hope, by digging the
ground, to find more statues; which it seems so far succeeded,
as to be much more worth than the purchase.
We spent the evening at the Chiesa Nova, where was
excellent music; but, before that began, the courteous
fathers led me into a nobly furnished library, contiguous
to their most beautiful convent.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
