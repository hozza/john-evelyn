<p>We passed by Villefranche, where
we dined, and so by Muneton, lying at Viaron-au-mouton,
which was twenty leagues. The next day by Murg to
Bourges, four leagues, where we spent the day. This is
the capital of Berry, an University much frequented by
the Dutch, situated on the river Eure. It stands high,
is strong, and well placed for defense; is environed with
meadows and vines, and the living here is very cheap.
In the suburbs of St. Privé, there is a fountain of sharp
water which they report wholesome against the stone.
They showed us a vast tree which they say stands in the
center of France. The French tongue is spoken with
great purity in this place. St. Stephen's church is the
cathedral, well built <i>à la Gothique</i>, full of sepulchres without-side,
with the representation of the final Judgment
over one of the ports. Here they show the chapel of
Claude de la Chastre, a famous soldier who had served
six kings of France in their wars. St. Chapelle is built
much like that at Paris, full of relics, and containing the
bones of one Briat, a giant of fifteen cubits high. It was
erected by John, Duke of Berry, and there is showed the
coronet of the dukedom. The great tower is a Pharos
for defense of the town, very strong, in thickness eighteen
feet, fortified with graffs and works; there is a garrison
in it, and a strange engine for throwing great stones,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and the iron cage where Louis, Duke of Orleans, was
kept by Charles VIII. Near the Town-house stands the
College of Jesuits, where was heretofore an Amphitheater.
I was courteously entertained by a Jesuit, who had us
into the garden, where we fell into disputation. The
house of Jaques Cœur is worth seeing. Bourges is an
Archbishopric and Primacy of Aquitaine. I took my leave
of Mr. Nicholas, and some other English there; and, on
the 23d, proceeded on my journey by Pont du Charge;
and lay that evening at Coulaiure, thirteen leagues.</p>
