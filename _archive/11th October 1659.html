<p>Came to visit me Mr.Â William
Coventry (since secretary to the Duke), son to the Lord
Keeper, a wise and witty gentleman.</p>

<p>The Army now turned out the Parliament. We had
now no government in the nation: all in confusion; no
magistrate either owned or pretended; but the soldiers,
and they not agreed. God Almighty have mercy on us,
and settle us!</p>
