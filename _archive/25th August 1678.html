<p>After evening prayer, visited Mr.
Sheldon (nephew to the late Archbishop of Canterbury),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and his pretty melancholy garden; I took notice of the
largest <i>arbor thuyris</i> I had ever seen. The place is finely
watered, and there are many curiosities of India, shown
in the house.</p>

<p>There was at Weybridge the Duchess of Norfolk, Lord
Thomas Howard (a worthy and virtuous gentleman,
with whom my son was sometime bred in Arundel House),
who was newly come from Rome, where he had been
some time; also one of the Duke's daughters, by his first
lady. My Lord leading me about the house made no
scruple of showing me all the hiding places for the Popish
priests, and where they said mass, for he was no
bigoted Papist. He told me he never trusted them with
any secret, and used Protestants only in all businesses
of importance.</p>

<p>I went this evening with my Lord Duke to Windsor,
where was a magnificent Court, it being the first time
of his Majesty's removing thither since it was repaired.</p>
