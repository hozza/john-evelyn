<p>We walked about two miles from the
city to an agreeable solitude, called Du Plessis, a house
belonging to the King. It has many pretty gardens,
full of nightingales; and, in the chapel, lies buried the
famous poet, Ronsard.</p>

<p>Returning, we stepped into a Convent of Franciscans,
called St. Cosmo, where the cloister is painted with the
miracles of their St. Francis à Paula, whose ashes lie in
their chapel, with this inscription: "<i>Corpus Sancti Fran. à
Paula 1507, 13 Aprilis, concrematur verò ab Hæreticis anno
1562, cujus quidem ossa et cineres hìc jacent</i>." The tomb has
four small pyramids of marble at each corner.</p>
