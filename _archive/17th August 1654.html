<p>Passed through Pontefract; the
castle famous for many sieges both of late and ancient
times, and the death of that unhappy King murdered in
it (Richard II.), was now demolishing by the Rebels; it
stands on a mount, and makes a goodly show at a distance.
The Queen has a house here, and there are many
fair seats near it, especially Mr. Pierrepont's, built at the
foot of a hill out of the castle ruins. We all alighted in
the highway to drink at a crystal spring, which they call
Robin Hood's Well; near it, is a stone chair, and an iron
ladle to drink out of, chained to the seat. We rode to
Tadcaster, at the side of which we have prospect of the
Archbishop's Palace (which is a noble seat), and in sight
of divers other gentlemen's fair houses. This tract is a
goodly, fertile, well-watered, and wooded country, abounding
with pasture and plenty of provisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">YORK</div>

<p>To York, the second city of England, fairly walled, of
a circular form, watered by the brave river Ouse, bearing
vessels of considerable burden on it; over it is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
stone bridge emulating that of London, and built on;
the middle arch is larger than any I have seen in England,
with a wharf of hewn stone, which makes the river
appear very neat. But most remarkable and worth seeing
is St. Peter's Cathedral, which of all the great
churches in England had been best preserved from the
fury of the sacrilegious, by composition with the Rebels
when they took the city, during the many incursions of
Scotch and others. It is a most entire magnificent piece
of Gothic architecture. The screen before the choir is of
stone carved with flowers, running work and statues of
the old kings. Many of the monuments are very ancient.
Here, as a great rarity in these days and at this time,
they showed me a Bible and Common Prayer Book covered
with crimson velvet, and richly embossed with silver
gilt; also a service for the altar of gilt wrought plate, flagons,
basin, ewer, plates, chalices, patins, etc., with a gorgeous
covering for the altar and pulpit, carefully preserved
in the vestry, in the hollow wall whereof rises a plentiful
spring of excellent water. I got up to the tower, whence
we had a prospect toward Durham, and could see Ripon,
part of Lancashire, the famous and fatal Marston Moor,
the Spas of Knaresborough, and all the environs of that
admirable country. Sir —— Ingoldsby has here a large
house, gardens, and tennis court; also the King's house
and church near the castle, which was modernly fortified
with a palisade and bastions. The streets are narrow
and ill-paved, the shops like London.</p>
