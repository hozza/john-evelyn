<p>The Duke of Albemarle was
going to Oxford, where both Court and Parliament had
been most part of the summer. There was no small suspicion
of my Lord Sandwich having permitted divers
commanders, who were at the taking of the East India<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
prizes, to break bulk, and to take to themselves jewels,
silks, etc.: though I believe some whom I could name filled
their pockets, my Lord Sandwich himself had the least
share. However, he underwent the blame, and it created
him enemies, and prepossessed the Lord General, for
he spoke to me of it with much zeal and concern, and I
believe laid load enough on Lord Sandwich at Oxford.</p>
