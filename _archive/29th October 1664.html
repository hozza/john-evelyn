<p>Was the most magnificent triumph
by water and land of the Lord Mayor. I dined at Guildhall
at the upper table, placed next to Sir H. Bennett,
Secretary of State, opposite to my Lord Chancellor and
the Duke of Buckingham, who sat between Monsieur
Comminges, the French Ambassador, Lord Treasurer,
the Dukes of Ormond and Albemarle, Earl of Manchester,
Lord Chamberlain, and the rest of the great officers
of state. My Lord Mayor came twice up to us, first
drinking in the golden goblet his Majesty's health, then
the French King's as a compliment to the Ambassador;
we returned my Lord Mayor's health, the trumpets and
drums sounding. The cheer was not to be imagined for
the plenty and rarity, with an infinite number of persons
at the tables in that ample hall. The feast was
said to cost Â£1,000. I slipped away in the crowd, and
came home late.</p>
