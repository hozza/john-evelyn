<p>Lying by the way from Wotton
at Sir Ralph Whitfield's, at Blechingley (whither both my
brothers had conducted me), I arrived at London on the
7th, and two days after took boat at the Tower-wharf,
which carried me as far as Sittingbourne, though not
without danger, I being only in a pair of oars, exposed
to a hideous storm: but it pleased God that we got in
before the peril was considerable. From thence, I went
by post to Dover, accompanied with one Mr.Â Thicknesse,
a very dear friend of mine.</p>
