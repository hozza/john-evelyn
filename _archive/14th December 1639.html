<p>According to injunctions from the
Heads of Colleges, I went (among the rest) to the Confirmation
at St. Mary's, where, after sermon, the Bishop
of Oxford laid his hands upon us, with the usual form
of benediction prescribed: but this received (I fear) for
the more part out of curiosity, rather than with that due
preparation and advice which had been requisite, could
not be so effectual as otherwise that admirable and useful
institution might have been, and as I have since deplored
it.</p>
