<p>Went with my wife and dear
Cousin to St. Germains, and kissed the Queen-Mother's
hand; dined with my Lord Keeper and Lord Hatton. Divers
of the great men of France came to see the King. The
next day, came the Prince of Cond√©. Returning to Paris,
we went to see the President Maison's palace, built cas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>tle-wise,
of a milk-white fine freestone; the house not
vast, but well contrived, especially the staircase, and the
ornaments of Putti, about it. It is environed in a dry
moat, the offices under ground, the gardens very excellent
with extraordinary long walks, set with elms, and a
noble prospect toward the forest, and on the Seine toward
Paris. Take it altogether, the meadows, walks,
river, forest, corn-ground, and vineyards, I hardly saw
anything in Italy to exceed it. The iron gates are very
magnificent. He has pulled down a whole village to
make room for his pleasure about it.</p>
