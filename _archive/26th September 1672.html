<p>I carried with me to dinner my
Lord H.Â Howard (now to be made Earl of Norwich and
Earl Marshal of England) to Sir Robert Clayton's, now
Sheriff of London, at his new house, where we had a
great feast; it is built indeed for a great magistrate, at
excessive cost. The cedar dining room is painted
with the history of the Giants' War, incomparably
done by Mr. Streeter, but the figures are too near the
eye.</p>
