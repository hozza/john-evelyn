<p>I went to the Exchange. The
late addition to the buildings is very noble; but the galleries
where they sell their petty merchandise nothing so
stately as ours at London, no more than the place where
they walk below, being only a low vault.</p>

<p>The Palaise, as they call the upper part, was built in
the time of Philip the Fair, noble and spacious. The
great Hall annexed to it, is arched with stone, having a
range of pillars in the middle, round which, and at the
sides, are shops of all kinds, especially booksellers'. One
side is full of pews for the clerks of the advocates, who
swarm here (as ours at Westminster). At one of the ends
stands an altar, at which mass is said daily. Within are
several chambers, courts, treasuries, etc. Above that is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the most rich and glorious Salle d'Audience, the chamber
of St. Louis, and other superior Courts where the Parliament
sits, richly gilt on embossed carvings and frets,
and exceedingly beautified.</p>

<p>Within the place where they sell their wares, is another
narrower gallery, full of shops and toys, etc., which looks
down into the prison-yard. Descending by a large pair
of stairs, we passed by Sainte Chapelle, which is a church
built by St. Louis, 1242, after the Gothic manner: it
stands on another church, which is under it, sustained
by pillars at the sides, which seem so weak as to appear
extraordinary in the artist. This chapel is most famous
for its relics, having as they pretend, almost the entire
crown of thorns: the agate patine, rarely sculptured,
judged one of the largest and best in Europe. There
was now a very beautiful spire erecting. The court below
is very spacious, capable of holding many coaches,
and surrounded with shops, especially engravers', goldsmiths',
and watchmakers'. In it are a fair fountain and
portico. The Isle du Palais consists of a triangular brick
building, whereof one side, looking to the river, is inhabited
by goldsmiths. Within the court are private dwellings.
The front, looking on the great bridge, is possessed
by mountebanks, operators, and puppet-players. On the
other part, is the every day's market for all sorts of provisions,
especially bread, herbs, flowers, orange trees,
choice shrubs. Here is a shop called NOAH'S ARK, where
are sold all curiosities, natural or artificial, Indian or
European, for luxury or use, as cabinets, shells, ivory,
porcelain, dried fishes, insects, birds, pictures, and a
thousand exotic extravagances. Passing hence, we viewed
the port Dauphine, an arch of excellent workmanship;
the street bearing the same name, is ample and straight.</p>
