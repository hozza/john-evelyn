<p>I saw his Majesty's Guards, being of
horse and foot 4,000, led by the General, the Duke of
Albemarle, in extraordinary equipage and gallantry, consisting
of gentlemen of quality and veteran soldiers,
excellently clad, mounted, and ordered, drawn up in
battalia before their Majesties in Hyde Park, where the
old Earl of Cleveland trailed a pike, and led the right-hand
file in a foot company, commanded by the Lord
Wentworth, his son; a worthy spectacle and example,
being both of them old and valiant soldiers. This was
to show the French Ambassador, Monsieur Comminges;
there being a great assembly of coaches, etc., in the park.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>
