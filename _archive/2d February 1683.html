<p>I made my court at St. James's,
when I saw the sea charts of Captain Collins, which that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
industrious man now brought to show the Duke, having
taken all the coasting from the mouth of the Thames,
as far as Wales, and exactly measuring every creek,
island, rock, soundings, harbors, sands, and tides, intending
next spring to proceed till he had finished the whole
island, and that measured by chains and other instruments:
a most exact and useful undertaking. He affirmed,
that of all the maps put out since, there are none extant
so true as those of Joseph Norden, who gave us the
first in Queen Elizabeth's time; all since him are erroneous.</p>
