<p>We lay at Cannes, which is a
small port on the Mediterranean; here we agreed with
a seaman to carry us to Genoa, and, having procured a
bill of health (without which there is no admission at any
town in Italy), we embarked on the 12th. We touched
at the islands of St. Margaret and St. Honore, lately retaken
from the Spaniards with great bravery by Prince
Harcourt. Here, having paid some small duty, we
bought some trifles offered us by the soldiers, but without
going on shore. Hence, we coasted within two leagues
of Antibes, which is the utmost town in France. Thence
by Nice, a city in Savoy, built all of brick, which gives
it a very pleasant appearance toward the sea, having a
very high castle which commands it. We sailed by
Morgus, now called Monaco, having passed Villa Franca,
heretofore Portus Herculis, when, arriving after the gates
were shut, we were forced to abide all night in the
barge, which was put into the haven, the wind coming
contrary. In the morning, we were hastened away, having
no time permitted us by our avaricious master to go
up and see this strong and considerable place, which
now belongs to a prince of the family of Grimaldi, of
Genoa, who has put both it and himself under the protection
of the French. The situation is on a promontory
of solid stone and rock. The town walls very fair. We
were told that within it was an ample court, and a
palace, furnished with the most rich and princely movables,
and a collection of statues, pictures, and massy
plate to an immense amount.</p>



<p>We sailed by Menton and Ventimiglia, being the first
city of the republic of Genoa; supped at Oneglia, where
we anchored and lay on shore. The next morning, we
coasted in view of the Isle of Corsica, and St. Remo,
where the shore is furnished with evergreens, oranges,
citrons, and date trees; we lay at Port Mauritio. The
next morning by Diano, Araisso, famous for the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
coral fishing, growing in abundance on the rocks, deep
and continually covered by the sea. By Albenga and
Finale, a very fair and strong town belonging to the
King of Spain, for which reason a monsieur in our vessel
was extremely afraid, as was the patron of our bark,
for they frequently catch French prizes as they creep by
these shores to go into Italy; <span class="sidenote">SAVONA</span>he therefore plied both sails
and oars, to get under the protection of a Genoese galley
that passed not far before us, and in whose company
we sailed as far as the Cape of Savona, a town built at the
rise of the Apennines: for all this coast (except a little
of St. Remo) is a high and steep mountainous ground,
consisting all of rock-marble, without any grass, tree, or
rivage, formidable to look on. A strange object it is, to
consider how some poor cottages stand fast on the declivities
of these precipices, and by what steps the inhabitants
ascend to them. The rock consists of all sorts of
the most precious marbles.</p>

<p>Here, on the 15th, forsaking our galley, we encountered
a little foul weather, which made us creep <i>terra,
terra</i>, as they call it, and so a vessel that encountered
us advised us to do; but our patron, striving to double
the point of Savona, making out into the wind put us
into great hazard; for blowing very hard from land between
those horrid gaps of the mountains, it set so violently,
as raised on the sudden so great a sea, that we
could not recover the weather-shore for many hours,
insomuch that, what with the water already entered, and
the confusion of fearful passengers (of which one was
an Irish bishop, and his brother, a priest, were confessing
some as at the article of death), we were almost
abandoned to despair, our pilot himself giving us up for
lost. And now, as we were weary with pumping and
laving out the water, almost sinking, it pleased God on
the sudden to appease the wind, and with much ado and
great peril we recovered the shore, which we now kept
in view within half a league in sight of those pleasant
villas, and within scent of those fragrant orchards which
are on this coast, full of princely retirements for the
sumptuousness of their buildings, and nobleness of the
plantations, especially those at St. Pietro d'Arena; from
whence, the wind blowing as it did, might perfectly be
smelt the peculiar joys of Italy in the perfumes of orange,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
citron, and jasmine flowers, for divers leagues seaward.<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19_19">19</a></p>
