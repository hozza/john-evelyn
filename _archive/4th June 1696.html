<p>A committee met at Whitehall about
Greenwich Hospital, at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's
Surveyor-General. We made the first agreement
with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for
weekly payments to the workmen, and a general account
to be monthly.</p>
