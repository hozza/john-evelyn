<p>Dined at Captain Graham's, where
I became acquainted with Dr. Compton (brother to the
Earl of Northampton), now Bishop of London, and Mr.
North, son to the Lord North, brother to the Lord Chief-Justice
and Clerk of the Closet, a most hopeful young
man. The Bishop had once been a soldier, had also
traveled in Italy, and became a most sober, grave, and excellent
prelate.</p>
