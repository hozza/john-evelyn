<p>An Anabaptist, a very odd ignorant
person, a mechanic, I think, was Lord Mayor. The
King and Queen, and Dadi, the Pope's Nuncio, invited
to a feast at Guildhall. A strange turn of affairs, that
those who scandalized the Church of England as favorers
of Popery, should publicly invite an emissary from Rome,
one who represented the very person of their Antichrist!</p>
