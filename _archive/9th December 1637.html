<p>I offered at my first exercise in the
Hall, and answered my opponent; and, upon the 11th following,
declaimed in the chapel before the Master, Fellows,
and Scholars, according to the custom. The 15th
after, I first of all opposed in the Hall.</p>

<p>The Christmas ensuing, being at a Comedy which the
gentlemen of Exeter College presented to the University,
and standing, for the better advantage of seeing, upon a
table in the Hall, which was near to another, in the dark,
being constrained by the extraordinary press to quit my
station, in leaping down to save myself I dashed my right
leg with such violence against the sharp edge of the other
board, as gave me a hurt which held me in cure till almost
Easter, and confined me to my study.</p>
