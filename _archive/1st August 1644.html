<p>My valet, one Garro, a Spaniard,
born in Biscao, having misbehaved, I was forced to discharge
him; he demanded of me (besides his wages) no
less than 100 crowns to carry him to his country; refusing
to pay it, as no part of our agreement, he had the
impudence to arrest me; the next day I was to appear
in Court, where both our avocats pleaded before the
Lieutenant Civil; but it was so unreasonable a pretense,
that the Judge had not patience to hear it out. The
Judge immediately acquitted me, after he had reproached
the avocat who took part with my servant, he rose from
the Bench, and making a courteous excuse to me, that
being a stranger I should be so used, he conducted me
through the court to the street-door. This varlet afterward
threatened to pistol me. The next day, I waited
on the Lieutenant, to thank him for his great civility.</p>
