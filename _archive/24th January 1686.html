<p>Unheard-of cruelties to the persecuted
Protestants of France, such as hardly any age has
seen the like, even among the Pagans.</p>

<p>6th <a id="tn_png_261"></a><!--TN: Comma added after "February"-->February, 1686. Being the day on which his Majesty
began his reign, by order of Council it was to be solemnized
with a particular office and sermon, which the Bishop
of Ely preached at Whitehall on Numb. xi. 12; a Court
oration upon the regal office. It was much wondered at,
that this day, which was that of his late Majesty's death,
should be kept as a festival, and not the day of the
present King's coronation. It is said to have been formerly
the custom, though not till now since the reign of
King James I.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Monmouth, being in the same seat
with me at church, appeared with a very sad and afflicted
countenance.</p>
