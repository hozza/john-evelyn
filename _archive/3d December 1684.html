<p>I carried Mr. Justell and Mr.
Slingsby (Master of the Mint), to see Mr. Sheldon's
collection of medals. The series of Popes was rare, and
so were several among the moderns, especially that of
John Huss's martyrdom at Constance; of the Roman
Emperors, Consulars some Greek, etc., in copper, gold,
and silver; not many truly antique; a medallion of
Otho Paulus Æmilius, etc., ancient. They were held
at a price of £1,000; but not worth, I judge, above
£200.</p>
