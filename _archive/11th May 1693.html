<p>We accompanied my daughter to her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
husband's house, where with many of his and our relations
we were magnificently treated. There we left her
in an apartment very richly adorned and furnished, and
I hope in as happy a condition as could be wished, and
with the great satisfaction of all our friends; for which
God be praised!</p>
