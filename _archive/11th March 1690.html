<p>I went again to see Mr. Charlton's
curiosities, both of art and nature, and his full and rare
collection of medals, which taken altogether, in all kinds,
is doubtless one of the most perfect assemblages of rarities
that can be any where seen. I much admired the
contortions of the Thea root, which was so perplexed,
large, and intricate, and withal hard as box, that it was
wonderful to consider. The French have landed in Ireland.</p>
