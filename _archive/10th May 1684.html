<p>I went to visit my brother in Surrey.
Called by the way at Ashted, where Sir Robert Howard
(Auditor of the Exchequer) entertained me very civilly
at his newly-built house, which stands in a park on the
Down, the avenue south; though down hill to the house,
which is not great, but with the outhouses very convenient.
The staircase is painted by Verrio with the story
of Astrea; among other figures is the picture of the
painter himself, and not unlike him; the rest is well
done, only the columns did not at all please me; there
is also Sir Robert's own picture in an oval; the whole in
<i>fresco</i>. The place has this great defect, that there is no
water but what is drawn up by horses from a very deep well.</p>
