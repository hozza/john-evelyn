<p>I saw a comedy acted at Court.
In the afternoon, I witnessed a wrestling match for Â£1,000
in St. James's Park, before his Majesty, a vast assemblage
of lords and other spectators, between the western and
northern men, Mr. Secretary Morice and Lord Gerard
being the judges. The western men won. Many great
sums were betted.</p>
