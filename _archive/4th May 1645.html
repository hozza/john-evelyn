<p>Having seen the entry of the ambassador
of Lucca, I went to the Vatican, where, by favor of
our Cardinal Protector, Fran. Barberini, I was admitted
into the Consistory, heard the ambassador make his oration
in Latin to the Pope, sitting on an elevated state,
or throne, and changing two pontifical mitres; after which,
I was presented to kiss his toe, that is, his embroidered
slipper, two Cardinals holding up his vest and surplice;
and then, being sufficiently blessed with his thumb and
two fingers for that day I returned home to dinner.</p>

<p>We went again to see the medals of Signor Gotefredi,
which are absolutely the best collection in Rome.</p>

<p>Passing the Ludovisia Villa, where the petrified human
figure lies, found on the snowy Alps; I measured the
hydra, and found it not a foot long; the three necks and
fifteen heads seem to be but patched up with several
pieces of serpents' skins.</p>
