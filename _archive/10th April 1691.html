<p>This night, a sudden and terrible
fire burned down all the buildings over the stone gallery
at Whitehall to the water side, beginning at the apartment
of the late Duchess of Portsmouth (which had been
pulled down and rebuilt no less than three times to
please her), and consuming other lodgings of such lewd
creatures, who debauched both King Charles II. and
others, and were his destruction.</p>

<p>The King returned out of Holland just as this accident
happenedâ€”Proclamation against the Papists, etc.</p>
