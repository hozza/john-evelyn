<p>Went to Mr. Cowley's funeral, whose
corpse lay at Wallingford House, and was thence conveyed
to Westminster Abbey in a hearse with six horses and all
funeral decency, near a hundred coaches of noblemen and
persons of quality following; among these, all the wits of
the town, divers bishops and clergymen. He was interred
next Geoffry Chaucer, and near Spenser. A goodly monument
is since erected to his memory.</p>

<p>Now did his Majesty again dine in the presence, in
ancient state, with music and all the court ceremonies,
which had been interrupted since the late war.</p>
