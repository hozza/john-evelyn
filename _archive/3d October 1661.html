<p>Next evening, being in the withdrawing-room
adjoining the bedchamber, his Majesty espying
me came to me from a great crowd of noblemen standing
near the fire, and asked me if I had done; and told
me he feared it might be a little too sharp, on second
thoughts, for he had that morning spoken with the
French Ambassador, who it seems had palliated the
matter, and was very tame; and therefore directed me
where I should soften a period or two, before it was published
(as afterward it was). This night also he spoke to
me to give him a sight of what was sent, and to bring
it to him in his bedchamber; which I did, and received
it again from him at dinner, next day. By Saturday,
having finished it with all his Majesty's notes, the King
being gone abroad, I sent the papers to Sir Henry Bennett
(Privy-Purse and a great favorite), and slipped home,
being myself much indisposed and harassed with going
about, and sitting up to write.</p>
