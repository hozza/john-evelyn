<p>Through part of Huntingdonshire,
we passed that town, fair and ancient, a river running
by it. The country about it so abounds in wheat that,
when any King of England passes through it, they
have a custom to meet him with a hundred plows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAMBRIDGE</div>

<p>This evening, to Cambridge; and went first to St.
John's College, well built of brick, and library, which I
think is the fairest of that University. One Mr.Â Benlowes
has given it all the ornaments of <i>pietra commessa</i>,<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_51_51">51</a>
whereof a table and one piece of perspective is very
fine; other trifles there also be of no great value, besides
a vast old song-book, or Service, and some fair manuscripts.
There hangs in the library the picture of John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Williams, Archbishop of York, sometime Lord Keeper,
my kinsman, and their great benefactor.</p>

<p>Trinity College is said by some to be the fairest quadrangle
of any university in Europe; but in truth is far
inferior to that of Christ Church, in Oxford; the hall is
ample and of stone, the fountain in the quadrangle is
graceful, the chapel and library fair. There they showed
us the prophetic manuscript of the famous Grebner, but
the passage and emblem which they would apply to our
late King, is manifestly relating to the Swedish; in truth,
it seems to be a mere fantastic rhapsody, however the
title may bespeak strange revelations. There is an office
in manuscript with fine miniatures, and some other antiquities,
given by the Countess of Richmond, mother
of Henry VIII., and the before-mentioned Archbishop
Williams, when Bishop of Lincoln. The library is pretty
well stored. The Greek Professor had me into another
large quadrangle cloistered and well built, and gave us
a handsome collation in his own chamber.</p>

<p>Thence to Caius, and afterward to King's College, where
I found the chapel altogether answered expectation, especially
the roof, all of stone, which for the flatness of
its laying and carving may, I conceive, vie with any in
Christendom. The contignation of the roof (which I went
upon), weight, and artificial joining of the stones is admirable.
The lights are also very fair. In one aisle lies
the famous Dr. Collins, so celebrated for his fluency in
the Latin tongue. From this roof we could descry Ely,
and the encampment of Sturbridge fair now beginning
to set up their tents and booths; also Royston, Newmarket,
etc., houses belonging to the King. The library is
too narrow.</p>

<p>Clare-Hall is of a new and noble design, but not finished.</p>

<p>Peter-House, formerly under the government of my
worthy friend, Dr. Joseph Cosin, Dean of Peterborough;
a pretty neat college, having a delicate chapel. Next to
Sidney, a fine college.</p>

<p>Catherine-Hall, though a mean structure, is yet famous
for the learned Bishop Andrews, once Master. Emanuel
College, that zealous house, where to the hall they have
a parlor for the Fellows. The chapel is reformed, <i>ab
origine</i>, built north and south, and meanly erected, as is
the library.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus-College, one of the best built, but in a melancholy
situation. Next to Christ-College, a very noble
erection, especially the modern part, built without the
quadrangle toward the gardens, of exact architecture.</p>

<p>The Schools are very despicable, and Public Library
but mean, though somewhat improved by the wainscoting
and books lately added by the Bishop Bancroft's
library and MSS. They showed us little of antiquity,
only King James's Works, being his own gift, and kept
very reverently.</p>

<p>The market place is very ample, and remarkable for
old Hobson, the pleasant carrier's beneficence of a fountain.<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_52_52">52</a>
But the whole town is situate in a low, dirty, unpleasant
place, the streets ill-paved, the air thick and
infected by the fens, nor are its churches, (of which St.
Mary's is the best) anything considerable in compare to
Oxford.<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_53_53">53</a></p>

<p>From Cambridge, we went to Audley-End, and spent
some time in seeing that goodly place built by Howard,
Earl of Suffolk, once Lord Treasurer. It is a mixed
fabric, between antique and modern, but observable for
its being completely finished, and without comparison is
one of the stateliest palaces in the kingdom. It consists
of two courts, the first very large, winged with cloisters.
The front had a double entrance; the hall is fair, but
somewhat too small for so august a pile. The kitchen is
very large, as are the cellars, arched with stone, very
neat and well disposed; these offices are joined by a wing
out of the way very handsomely. The gallery is the
most cheerful and I think one of the best in England; a
fair dining-room, and the rest of the lodgings answerable,
with a pretty chapel. The gardens are not in order,
though well inclosed. It has also a bowling-alley, a noble
well-walled, wooded and watered park, full of fine <i>collines</i>
and ponds: the river glides before the palace, to which
is an avenue of lime trees, but all this is much diminished
by its being placed in an obscure bottom. For the rest,
is a perfectly uniform structure, and shows without
like a diadem, by the decorations of the cupolas and
other ornaments on the pavilions; instead of rails and
balusters, there is a border of capital letters, as was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
lately also on Suffolk-House, near Charing-Cross, built
by the same Lord Treasurer.</p>

<p>This house stands in the parish of Saffron Walden,
famous for the abundance of saffron there cultivated, and
esteemed the best of any foreign country.</p>
