<p>Being invited by Lord Berkeley,
I went to Durdans, where dined his Majesty, the Queen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
Duke, Duchess, Prince Rupert, Prince Edward, and
abundance of noblemen. I went, after dinner, to visit
my brother of Woodcot, my sister having been delivered
of a son a little before, but who had now been two days dead.</p>
