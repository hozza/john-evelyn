<p>I went with some company to
see some remarkable places without the city: as the Isle,
and how it is encompassed by the Rivers Seine and the
Ouse. The city is divided into three parts, whereof the
town is greatest. The city lies between it and the University
in form of an island. Over the Seine is a stately
bridge called Pont Neuf, begun by Henry III. in 1578,
finished by Henry IV. his successor. It is all of hewn
freestone found under the streets, but more plentifully at
Montmartre, and consists of twelve arches, in the midst
of which ends the point of an island, on which are built
handsome artificers' houses. There is one large passage
for coaches, and two for foot passengers three or four feet
higher, and of convenient breadth for eight or ten to go
abreast. On the middle of this stately bridge, on one
side, stands the famous statue of Henry the Great on
horseback, exceeding the natural proportion by much; and,
on the four faces of a stately pedestal (which is composed
of various sorts of polished marbles and rich moldings),
inscriptions of his victories and most signal actions are
engraven in brass. The statue and horse are of copper,
the work of the great John di Bologna, and sent from
Florence by Ferdinand the First, and Cosmo the Second,
uncle and cousin to Mary de Medicis, the wife of King
Henry, whose statue it represents. The place where it is
erected is inclosed with a strong and beautiful grate of
iron, about which there are always mountebanks showing
their feats to the idle passengers. From hence is a rare
prospect toward the Louvre and suburbs of St. Germains,
the Isle du Palais, and Nôtre Dame. At the foot of this
bridge is a water-house, on the front whereof, at a great
height, is the story of Our Savior and the woman of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Samaria pouring water out of a bucket. Above, is a very
rare dial of several motions, with a chime, etc. The water
is conveyed by huge wheels, pumps, and other engines,
from the river beneath. The confluence of the people
and multitude of coaches passing every moment over
the bridge, to a new spectator is an agreeable diversion.
Other bridges there are, as that of Nôtre Dame and the
Pont-au-Change, etc., fairly built, with houses of stone,
which are laid over this river; only the Pont St. Anne,
landing the suburbs of St. Germains at the Tuileries, is
built of wood, having likewise a water house in the midst
of it, and a statue of Neptune casting water out of a
whale's mouth, of lead, but much inferior to the Samaritan.</p>

<p>The University lies southwest on higher ground, contiguous
to, but the lesser part of, Paris. They reckon no
less than sixty-five colleges; but they in nothing approach
ours at Oxford for state and order. The booksellers dwell
within the University. The schools (of which more hereafter)
are very regular.</p>

<p>The suburbs are those of St. Denis, Honoré, St. Marcel,
St. Jaques, St. Michael, St. Victoire, and St. Germains,
which last is the largest, and where the nobility and
persons of best quality are seated: and truly Paris, comprehending
the suburbs, is, for the material the houses
are built with, and many noble and magnificent piles,
one of the most gallant cities in the world; large in
circuit, of a round form, very populous, but situated in
a bottom, environed with gentle declivities, rendering
some places very dirty, and making it smell as if sulphur
were mingled with the mud; yet it is paved with a kind
of freestone, of near a foot square, which renders it
more easy to walk on than our pebbles in London.</p>

<p>On Christmas eve, I went to see the Cathedral at Nôtre
Dame, erected by Philip Augustus, but begun by King
Robert, son of Hugh Capet. It consists of a Gothic
fabric, sustained with 120 pillars, which make two aisles
in the church round about the choir, without comprehending
the chapels, being 174 paces long, 60 wide, and 100
high. The choir is inclosed with stonework graven with
the sacred history, and contains forty-five chapels chancelled
with iron. At the front of the chief entrance are
statues in relievo of the kings, twenty-eight in number,
from Childebert to the founder, Philip; and above them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
are two high square towers, and another of a smaller size,
bearing a spire in the middle, where the body of the
church forms a cross. The great tower is ascended by
389 steps, having twelve galleries from one to the other.
They greatly reverence the crucifix over the screen of
the choir, with an image of the Blessed Virgin. There
are some good modern paintings hanging on the pillars.
The most conspicuous statute is the huge colossal one of
St. Christopher; with divers other figures of men, houses,
prospects and rocks, about this gigantic piece; being of
one stone, and more remarkable for its bulk than any
other perfection. This is the prime church of France for
dignity, having archdeacons, vicars, canons, priests, and
chaplains in good store, to the number of 127. It is also
the palace of the archbishop. The young king was there
with a great and martial guard, who entered the nave
of the church with drums and fifes, at the ceasing of
which I was entertained with the church music; and so
I left him.</p>
