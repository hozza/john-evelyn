<p>I proceeded to Canterbury, Dover,
Deal, the Isle of Thanet, by Sandwich, and so to Margate.
Here we had abundance of miserably wounded men, his
Majesty sending his chief chirurgeon, Sergeant Knight, to
meet me, and Dr. Waldrond had attended me all the
journey. Having taken order for the accommodation of
the wounded, I came back through a country the best
cultivated of any that in my life I had anywhere seen,
every field lying as even as a bowling-green, and the
fences, plantations, and husbandry, in such admirable
order, as infinitely delighted me, after the sad and afflicting
spectacles and objects I was come from. Observing
almost every tall tree to have a weathercock on the top
bough, and some trees half-a-dozen, I learned that, on a
certain holyday, the farmers feast their servants; at
which solemnity, they set up these cocks, in a kind of
triumph.</p>

<p>Being come back toward Rochester, I went to take order
respecting the building a strong and high wall about a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
house I had hired of a gentleman, at a place called Hartlip,
for a prison, paying Â£50 yearly rent. Here I settled
a Provost-Marshal and other officers, returning by Feversham.
On the 30th heard a sermon in Rochester cathedral,
and so got to Sayes Court on the first of <a id="tn_png_092"></a><!--TN: Period added after "April"-->April.</p>
