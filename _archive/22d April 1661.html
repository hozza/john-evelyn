<p>Was the splendid cavalcade of his
Majesty from the Tower of London to Whitehall, when
I saw him in the Banqueting House create six Earls,
and as many Barons, viz:</p>

<p>Edward Lord Hyde, Lord Chancellor, Earl of Claren<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>don;
supported by the Earls of Northumberland and
Sussex; the Earl of Bedford carried the cap and coronet,
the Earl of Warwick, the sword, the Earl of Newport,
the mantle.</p>

<p>The Barons were: Denzille Holles; Cornwallis; Booth;
Townsend; Cooper; Crew; who were led up by several
Peers, with Garter and officers of arms before them; when,
after obedience on their several approaches to the throne,
their patents were presented by Garter King-at-Arms,
which being received by the Lord Chamberlain, and delivered
to his Majesty, and by him to the Secretary of
State, were read, and then again delivered to his Majesty,
and by him to the several Lords created; they
were then robed, their coronets and collars put on by his
Majesty, and they were placed in rank on both sides of
the state and throne; but the Barons put off their caps
and circles, and held them in their hands, the Earls
keeping on their coronets, as cousins to the King.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the evening in seeing the several
archtriumphals built in the streets at several eminent
places through which his Majesty was next day to pass,
some of which, though temporary, and to stand but one
year, were of good invention and architecture, with inscriptions.</p>
