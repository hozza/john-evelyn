<p>A <span class="small">YOUNG PRINCE</span> born, which will cause
disputes.</p>

<p>About two o'clock, we heard the Tower ordnance discharged,
and the bells ring for the birth of a Prince of
Wales. This was very surprising, it having been universally
given out that her Majesty did not look till the next
month.</p>
