<p>The Lord Mayor and Aldermen made
their addresses to the Queen, presenting her Â£1,000 in
gold. Now saw I her Portuguese ladies, and the Guardadamas,
or mother of her maids,<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_71_71">71</a> and the old knight, a
lock of whose hair quite covered the rest of his bald
pate, bound on by a thread, very oddly. I saw the rich
gondola sent to his Majesty from the State of Venice;
but it was not comparable for swiftness to our common
wherries, though managed by Venetians.</p>
