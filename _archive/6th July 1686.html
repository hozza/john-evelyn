<p>I supped with the Countess of Rochester,
where was also the Duchess of Buckingham and
Madame de Govern√®, whose daughter was married to
the Marquis of Halifax's son. She made me a character
of the French King and Dauphin, and of the persecution;
that they kept much of the cruelties from the
King's knowledge; that the Dauphin was so afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
his father, that he dared not let anything appear of his
sentiments; that he hated letters and priests, spent all
his time in hunting, and seemed to take no notice of
what was passing.</p>

<p>This lady was of a great family and fortune, and had
fled hither for refuge.</p>
