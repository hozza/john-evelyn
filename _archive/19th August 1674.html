<p>His Majesty told me how exceedingly
the Dutch were displeased at my treatise of the
"History of Commerce;" that the Holland Ambassador
had complained to him of what I had touched of the
Flags and Fishery, etc., and desired the book might be
called in; while on the other side, he assured me he was
exceedingly pleased with what I had done, and gave me
many thanks. However, it being just upon conclusion of
the treaty of Breda (indeed it was designed to have been
published some months before and when we were at defiance),
his Majesty told me he must recall it formally;
but gave order that what copies should be publicly
seized to pacify the Ambassador, should immediately be
restored to the printer, and that neither he nor the vender
should be molested. The truth is, that which touched
the Hollander was much less than what the King himself
furnished me with, and obliged me to publish, having
caused it to be read to him before it went to press;
but the error was, it should have been published before
the peace was proclaimed. The noise of this book's suppression
made it presently to be bought up, and turned
much to the stationer's advantage. It was no other than
the preface prepared to be prefixed to my "History of the
Whole War;" which I now pursued no further.</p>
