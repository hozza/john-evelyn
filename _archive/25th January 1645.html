<p>I went again to the Palazzo Farnese,
to see some certain statues and antiquities which, by reason
of the Major-Domo not being within, I could not
formerly obtain. In the hall stands that triumphant
Colosse of one of the family, upon three figures, a modern,
but rare piece. About it stood some Gladiators; and,
at the entrance into one of the first chambers, are two
cumbent figures of <span class="smcap">Age</span> and <span class="smcap">Youth</span>, brought hither from
St. Peter's to make room for the Longinus under the
cupola. Here was the statue of a ram running at a man
on horseback, a most incomparable expression of Fury,
cut in stone; and a table of <i>pietra-commessa</i>, very curious.
The next chamber was all painted <i>a fresco</i>, by a rare
hand, as was the carving in wood of the ceiling, which,
as I remember, was in cedar, as the Italian mode is, and
not poor plaster, as ours are; some of them most richly
gilt. In a third room, stood the famous Venus, and the
child Hercules strangling a serpent, of Corinthian brass,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
antique, on a very curious basso-relievo; the sacrifice to
Priapus; the Egyptian Isis, in the hard, black ophite
stone, taken out of the Pantheon, greatly celebrated by
the antiquaries: likewise two tables of brass, containing
divers old Roman laws. At another side of this chamber,
was the statue of a wounded Amazon falling from her
horse, worthy the name of the excellent sculptor, whoever
the artist was. Near this was a bass-relievo of a Bacchanalia,
with a most curious Silenus. The fourth room was
totally environed with statues; especially observable was
that so renowned piece of a Venus looking backward over
her shoulder, and divers other naked figures, by the old
Greek masters. Over the doors are two Venuses, one of
them looking on her face in a glass, by M. Angelo; the
other is painted by Caracci. I never saw finer faces,
especially that under the mask, whose beauty and art are
not to be described by words. The next chamber is also
full of statues; most of them the heads of Philosophers,
very antique. One of the Cæsars and another of Hannibal
cost 1,200 crowns. Now I had a second view of that
never-to-be-sufficiently-admired gallery, painted in deep
relievo, the work of ten years' study, for a trifling reward.
In the wardrobe above they showed us fine wrought plate,
porcelain, mazers of beaten and solid gold, set with diamonds,
rubies, and emeralds; a treasure, especially the
workmanship considered, of inestimable value. This is all
the Duke of Parma's. Nothing seemed to be more curious
and rare in its kind than the complete service of the
purest crystal, for the altar of the chapel, the very bell,
cover of a book, sprinkler, etc., were all of the rock, incomparably
sculptured, with the holy story in deep Levati;
thus was also wrought the crucifix, chalice, vases, flowerpots,
the largest and purest crystal that my eyes ever
beheld. Truly I looked on this as one of the greatest
curiosities I had seen in Rome. In another part were
presses furnished with antique arms, German clocks, perpetual
motions, watches, and curiosities of Indian works.
A very ancient picture of Pope Eugenius; a St. Bernard;
and a head of marble found long since, supposed to be a
true portrait of our Blessed Savior's face.</p>

<p>Hence, we went to see Dr. Gibbs, a famous poet and
countryman of ours, who had some intendency in an
hospital built on the Via Triumphalis, called Christ's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Hospital, which he showed us. The Infirmatory, where
the sick lay, was paved with various colored marbles,
and the walls hung with noble pieces; the beds are
very fair; in the middle is a stately cupola, under which
is an altar decked with divers marble statues, all in
sight of the sick, who may both see and hear mass, as
they lie in their beds. The organs are very fine, and
frequently played on to recreate the people in pain. To
this joins an apartment destined for the orphans; and
there is a school: the children wear blue, like ours in
London, at an hospital of the same appellation. Here
are forty nurses, who give suck to such children as are
accidentally found exposed and abandoned. In another
quarter, are children of a bigger growth, 450 in number,
who are taught letters. In another, 500 girls, under
the tuition of divers religious matrons, in a monastery,
as it were, by itself. I was assured there were at least
2,000 more maintained in other places. I think one
apartment had in it near 1,000 beds; these are in a very
long room, having an inner passage for those who attend,
with as much care, sweetness, and conveniency as
can be imagined, the Italians being generally very neat.
Under the portico, the sick may walk out and take the
air. Opposite to this, are other chambers for such as
are sick of maladies of a more rare and difficult cure,
and they have rooms apart. At the end of the long
corridor is an apothecary's shop, fair and very well stored;
near which are chambers for persons of better quality,
who are yet necessitous. Whatever the poor bring is, at
their coming in, delivered to a treasurer, who makes an
inventory, and is accountable to them, or their representatives
if they die.</p>

<p>To this building joins the house of the commendator,
who, with his officers attending the sick, make up ninety
persons; besides a convent and an ample church for the
friars and priests who daily attend. The church is extremely
neat, and the <i>sacristia</i> is very rich. Indeed it is
altogether one of the most pious and worthy foundations
I ever saw. Nor is the benefit small which divers young
physicians and chirurgeons reap by the experience they
learn here among the sick, to whom those students have
free access. Hence, we ascended a very steep hill, near
the Port St. Pancratio, to that stately fountain called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Acqua Paula, being the aqueduct which Augustus had
brought to Rome, now re-edified by Paulus V.; a rare
piece of architecture, and which serves the city after a
journey of thirty-five miles, here pouring itself into divers
ample lavers, out of the mouths of swans and dragons,
the arms of this Pope. Situate on a very high mount, it
makes a most glorious show to the city, especially when
the sun darts on the water as it gusheth out. The inscriptions
on it are:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Paulus V. Romanus Pontifex Opt. Max. Aquæductus ab Augusto
Cæsare extructos, ævi longinquâ vetustate collapsos, in ampliorem <a id="tn_png_171"></a><!--TN: "forman" changed to "formam"-->formam
restituit anno salutis M.D.CIX. Pont. V.</i>"</p>

<p>And toward the fields:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Paulus V. Rom. Pontifex Optimus Maximus, priori ductu longissimi
temporis injuriâ penè diruto, sublimiorem.</i>"</p>


<p class="centerquot">*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p class="centerquot">[One or more leaves are here wanting in Evelyn's MS., descriptive
of other parts of Rome, and of his leaving the city.]</p>

<p>Thence to Velletri, a town heretofore of the Volsci,
where is a public and fair statue of P. Urban VIII., in
brass, and a stately fountain in the street. Here we lay
and drank excellent wine.</p>
