<p>I went to Wotton, the first time
after my brother's funeral, to furnish the house with
necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew Glanville, the
executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's. The weather was now altering
into sharp and hard frost.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons
on King Charles's Martyrdom, told them that the
observation of that day was not intended out of any
detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other
Kings and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves
toward their subjects, lest they should come to the same
end. This was so resented that, though it was usual to
desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one
should preach before them, who was not either a Dean
or a Doctor of Divinity.</p>
