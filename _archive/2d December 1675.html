<p>Being returned home, I visited
Lady Mordaunt at Parson's Green, my Lord, her son,
being sick. This pious woman delivered to me Â£100 to
bestow as I thought fit for the release of poor prisoners,
and other charitable uses.</p>

where I found the Bishop of Winchester, whom I had long
known in France; he invited me to his house at Chelsea.</p>
