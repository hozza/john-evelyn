<p>I visited the Marquis of Normanby,
and had much discourse concerning King Charles
II. being poisoned. Also concerning the <i>quinquina</i> which
the physicians would not give to the King, at a time
when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that
could cure him (out of envy because it had been brought
into vogue by Mr. Tudor, an apothecary), till Dr. Short,
to whom the King sent to know his opinion of it privately,
he being reputed a Papist (but who was in truth a very
honest, good Christian), sent word to the King that
it was the only thing which could save his life, and then
the King enjoined his physicians to give it to him, which
they did and he recovered. Being asked by this Lord
why they would not prescribe it, Dr. Lower said it
would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and
at last confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.
Exception was taken that the late Archbishop did not
cause any of his Chaplains to use any office for the sick
during his illness.</p>
