<p>Though this day was set apart
expressly for celebrating the memorable birth, return,
and restoration of the late King Charles II., there was
no notice taken of it, nor any part of the office annexed
to the Common Prayer Book made use of, which I
think was ill done, in regard his restoration not only
redeemed us from anarchy and confusion, but restored
the Church of England as it were miraculously.</p>
