<p>In the morning, his Majesty went to
chapel with the Knights of the Garter, all in their habits
and robes, ushered by the heralds; after the first service,
they went in procession, the youngest first, the Sovereign
last, with the Prelate of the Order and Dean, who had
about his neck the book of the Statutes of the Order; and
then the Chancellor of the Order (old Sir Henry de Vic),
who wore the purse about his neck; then the Heralds
and Garter King-at-Arms, Clarencieux, Black Rod. But
before the Prelate and Dean of Windsor went the gentlemen
of the chapel and choristers, singing as they marched;
behind them two doctors of music in damask robes; this
procession was about the courts at Whitehall. Then,
returning to their stalls and seats in the chapel, placed
under each knight's coat-armor and titles, the second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
service began. Then, the King offered at the altar, an
anthem was sung; then, the rest of the Knights offered,
and lastly proceeded to the banqueting-house to a great
feast. The King sat on an elevated throne at the upper
end at a table alone; the Knights at a table on the right
hand, reaching all the length of the room; over against
them a cupboard of rich gilded plate; at the lower end,
the music; on the balusters above, wind music, trumpets,
and kettle-drums. The King was served by the lords and
pensioners who brought up the dishes. About the middle
of the dinner, the Knights drank the King's health, then
the King, theirs, when the trumpets and music played and
sounded, the guns going off at the Tower. At the Banquet,
came in the Queen, and stood by the King's left
hand, but did not sit. Then was the banqueting-stuff
flung about the room profusely. In truth, the crowd was
so great, that though I stayed all the supper the day
before, I now stayed no longer than this sport began, for
fear of disorder. The cheer was extraordinary, each
Knight having forty dishes to his mess, piled up five or
six high; the room hung with the richest tapestry.</p>
