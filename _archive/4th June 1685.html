Sir Gabriel Sylvius, now going Envoy-extraordinary into
Denmark, with his secretary and chaplain, a Frenchman,
who related the miserable persecution of the Protestants
in France; not above ten churches left them, and those
also threatened to be demolished; they were commanded

England, and the Plantations. There were with Sir
Gabriel, his lady, Sir William Godolphin and sisters, and

them to the water side where Sir Gabriel embarked, and
the rest returned to London.</p>
