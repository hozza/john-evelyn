<p>I dined at Mr. Blathwaite's (two miles
from Hampton). This gentleman is Secretary of War,
Clerk of the Council, etc., having raised himself by his
industry from very moderate circumstances. He is a very
proper, handsome person, very dexterous in business, and
besides all this, has married a great fortune. His income
by the Army, Council, and Secretary to the Committee of
Foreign Plantations, brings him in above Â£2,000 per
annum.</p>
