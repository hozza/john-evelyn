<p>From Wotton I went to see Mr.
Hussey (at Sutton in Shere), who has a very pretty seat
well watered, near my brother's. He is the neatest husband
for curious ordering his domestic and field accommodations,
and what pertains to husbandry, that I have
ever seen, as to his granaries, tacklings, tools, and utensils,
plows, carts, stables, wood piles, wood houses, even to
hen roosts and hog troughs. Methought, I saw old Cato,
or Varro, in him; all substantial, all in exact order. The
sole inconvenience he lies under, is the great quantity of
sand which the stream brings along with it, and fills his
canals and receptacles for fish too soon. The rest of my
time of stay at Wotton was spent in walking about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
grounds and goodly woods, where I have in my youth so
often entertained my solitude; and so, on the 2d of September,
I once more returned to my home.</p>
