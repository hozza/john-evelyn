<p>Came Sir John Duncomb and Mr. Thomas
Chicheley, both Privy Councillors and Commissioners of
His Majesty's Ordnance, to visit me, and let me know
that his Majesty had in Council, nominated me to be one
of the Commissioners for regulating the farming and making
of saltpetre through the whole kingdom, and that we were
to sit in the Tower the next day. When they were gone,
came to see me Sir John Cotton, heir to the famous
antiquary, Sir Robert Cotton: a pretended great Grecian,
but had by no means the parts, or genius of his grandfather.</p>
