<p>We went to St. Gatian, reported to
have been built by our countrymen; the dial and clockwork
are much esteemed. The church has two handsome
towers and spires of stone, and the whole fabric is very
noble and venerable. To this joins the palace of the
Archbishop, consisting both of old and new building,
with many fair rooms, and a fair garden. Here I grew
acquainted with one Monsieur Merey, a very good musician.
The Archbishop treated me very courteously.
We visited divers other <a id="tn_png_097"></a><!--TN: Comma added after "churches"-->churches, chapels, and monasteries
for the most part neatly built, and full of pretty
paintings, especially the Convent of the Capuchins,
which has a prospect over the whole city, and many fair
walks.</p>
