<p>I had this day been married thirty-nine
yearsâ€”blessed be God for all his mercies!</p>

<p>The new very young Lord Chief-Justice Herbert declared
on the bench, that the government of England
was entirely in the King; that the Crown was absolute;
that penal laws were powers lodged in the Crown
to enable the King to force the execution of the law,
but were not bars to bind the King's power; that he
could pardon all offenses against the law, and forgive the
penalties, and why could he not dispense with them; by
which the Test was abolished? Everyone was astonished.
Great jealousies as to what would be the end of
these proceedings.</p>
