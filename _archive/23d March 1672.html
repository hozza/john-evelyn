<p>Captain Cox, one of the Commissioners
of the Navy, furnishing me with a yatch, I sailed
to Sheerness to see that fort also, now newly finished;
several places on both sides the Swale and Medway to
Gillingham and Upnore, being also provided with redoubts
and batteries to secure the station of our men-of-war
at Chatham, and shut the door when the steeds
were stolen.</p>
