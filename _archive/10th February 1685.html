<p>Being sent to by the Sheriff of
the County to appear and assist in proclaiming the King,
I went the next day to Bromley, where I met the Sheriff
and the Commander of the Kentish Troop, with an appearance,
I suppose, of about 500 horse, and innumerable
people, two of his Majesty's trumpets, and a Sergeant
with other officers, who having drawn up the horse in a
large field near the town, marched thence, with swords
drawn, to the market place, where, making a ring, after
sound of trumpets and silence made, the High Sheriff
read the proclaiming titles to his bailiff, who repeated
them aloud, and then, after many shouts of the people,
his Majesty's health being drunk in a flint glass of a yard
long, by the Sheriff, Commander, Officers, and chief
gentlemen, they all dispersed, and I returned.</p>
