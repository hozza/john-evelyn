<p>After a long drought, we had a refreshing
shower. The day before, there was a dreadful
fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames side, which burned
divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred houses.
Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been
the richest lady in Europe. She was niece of Cardinal
Mazarin, and was married to the richest subject in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Europe, as is said. She was born at Rome, educated in
France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to
be abandoned by her husband, and banished, when she
came into England for shelter, lived on a pension given
her here, and is reported to have hastened her death by
intemperate drinking strong spirits. She has written her
own story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant
sister, wife to the noble family of Colonna.</p>
