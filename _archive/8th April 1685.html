<p>Being now somewhat composed after
my great affliction, I went to London to hear Dr. Tenison
(it being on a Wednesday in Lent) at Whitehall. I observed
that though the King was not in his seat above in
the chapel, the Doctor made his three congees, which
they were not used to do when the late King was absent,
making then one bowing only. I asked the reason; it was
said he had a special order so to do. The Princess of
Denmark was in the King's closet, but sat on the left hand
of the chair, the Clerk of the Closet standing by his
Majesty's chair, as if he had been present.</p>

<p>I met the Queen Dowager going now first from Whitehall
to dwell at Somerset House.</p>

<p>This day my brother of Wotton and Mr. Onslow were
candidates for Surrey against Sir Adam Brown and my
cousin, Sir Edward Evelyn, and were circumvented in
their election by a trick of the Sheriff's, taking advantage
of my brother's party going out of the small village
of Leatherhead to seek shelter and lodging, the afternoon
being tempestuous, proceeding to the election when they
were gone; they expecting the next morning; whereas
before and then they exceeded the other party by many
hundreds, as I am assured. The Duke of Norfolk led Sir
Edward Evelyn's and Sir Adam Brown's party. For this
Parliament, very mean and slight persons (some of them
gentlemen's servants, clerks, and persons neither of reputation
nor interest) were set up; but the country would
choose my brother whether he would or no, and he missed
it by the trick above mentioned. Sir Adam Brown was
so deaf, that he could not hear one word. Sir Edward
Evelyn was an honest gentleman, much in favor with his
Majesty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
