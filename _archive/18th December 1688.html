<p>I saw the King take barge to
Gravesend at twelve o'clockâ€”a sad sight! The Prince
comes to St. James's, and fills Whitehall with Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
guards. A Council of Peers meet about an expedient to
call a Parliament; adjourn to the House of Lords. The
Chancellor, Earl of Peterborough, and divers others taken.
The Earl of Sunderland flies; Sir Edward Hale, Walker,
and others, taken and secured.</p>

<p>All the world go to see the Prince at St. James's, where
there is a great Court. There I saw him, and several of
my acquaintance who came over with him. He is very
stately, serious and reserved. The English soldiers sent
out of town to disband them; not well pleased.</p>
