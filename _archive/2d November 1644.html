<p>We went from Sienna, desirous
of being present at the cavalcade of the new Pope, Innocent
X.,<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21_21">21</a> who had not yet made the grand procession to
St. John di Laterano. We set out by Porto Romano,
the country all about the town being rare for hunting
and game. Wild boar and venison are frequently sold in
the shops in many of the towns about it. We passed
near Monte Oliveto, where the monastery of that Order
is pleasantly situated, and worth seeing. Passing over a
bridge, which, by the inscription, appears to have been
built by Prince Matthias, we went through Buon-Convento,
famous for the death of the Emperor, Henry VII., who
was here poisoned with the Holy Eucharist. <span class="sidenote">TORRINIERI</span>Thence, we
came to Torrinieri, where we dined. This village is in a
sweet valley, in view of Montalcino, famous for the rare
Muscatello.<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22_22">22</a> After three miles more, we go by St. Quirico,
and lay at a private osteria near it, where, after we were
provided of lodging, came in Cardinal Donghi, a Genoese
by birth, now come from Rome; he was so civil as to
entertain us with great respect, hearing we were English,
for that, he told us he had been once in our country.
Among other discourse, he related how a dove had been
seen to sit on the chair in the Conclave at the election
of Pope Innocent, which he magnified as a great good
omen, with other particulars which we inquired of him,
till our suppers parted us. He came in great state with
his own bedstead and all the furniture, yet would by no
means suffer us to resign the room we had taken up in
the lodging before his arrival. Next morning, we rode
by Monte Pientio, or, as vulgarly called, Monte Mantumiato,
which is of an excessive height, ever and anon
peeping above any clouds with its snowy head, till we
had climbed to the inn at Radicofani, built by Ferdinand, the
great Duke, for the necessary refreshment of travelers
in so inhospitable a place. As we ascended, we entered
a very thick, solid, and dark body of clouds, looking like
rocks at a little distance, which lasted near a mile in going
up; they were dry misty vapors, hanging undissolved for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
a vast thickness, and obscuring both the sun and earth,
so that we seemed to be in the sea rather than in the
clouds, till, having pierced through it, we came into a
most serene heaven, as if we had been above all human
conversation, the mountain appearing more like a great
island than joined to any other hills; for we could perceive
nothing but a sea of thick clouds rolling under our feet
like huge waves, every now and then suffering the top
of some other mountain to peep through, which we could
discover many miles off: and between some breaches of
the clouds we could see landscapes and villages of the
subjacent country. This was one of the most pleasant,
new, and altogether surprising objects that I had ever
beheld.</p>

<p>On the summit of this horrid rock (for so it is) is built
a very strong fort, garrisoned, and somewhat beneath it
is a small town; the provisions are drawn up with ropes
and engines, the precipice being otherwise inaccessible.
At one end of the town lie heaps of rocks so strangely
broken off from the ragged mountain, as would affright
one with their horror and menacing postures. Just opposite
to the inn gushed out a plentiful and most useful
fountain which falls into a great trough of stone, bearing
the Duke of Tuscany's arms. Here we dined, and I
with my black lead pen took the prospect. It is one of
the utmost confines of the Etrurian State toward St.
Peter's Patrimony, since the gift of Matilda to Gregory
VII., as is pretended.</p>

<p>Here we pass a stone bridge, built by Pope Gregory
XIV., and thence immediately to Acquapendente, a town
situated on a very ragged rock, down which precipitates
an entire river (which gives it the denomination), with a
most horrid roaring noise. We lay at the posthouse, on
which is this inscription:</p>
<div class="centerpoem">
<div class="poem">
<span class="ia">"<i>L'Insegna della Posta, é posta a posta,</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In questa posta, fin che habbia à sua posta</i><br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ogn'un Cavallo a Vetturi in Posta.</i>"</span>
</div></div>

<p>Before it was dark, we went to see the Monastery of
the Franciscans, famous for six learned Popes, and sundry
other great scholars, especially the renowned physician
and anatomist, Fabricius de Acquapendente, who
was bred and born there.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
