<p>I went this afternoon to visit
Colonel Morley. After dinner I discoursed with him;
but he was very jealous, and would not believe that Monk
came in to do the King any service; I told him that he
might do it without him, and have all the honor. He
was still doubtful, and would resolve on nothing yet, so
I took leave.</p>
