<p>I saw one Carr pilloried at Charing-cross
for a libel, which was burnt before him by the
hangman.</p>

<p>8th January, 1667-68. I saw deep and prodigious gaming
at the Groom-Porter's, vast heaps of gold squandered
away in a vain and profuse manner. This I looked on as
a horrid vice, and unsuitable in a Christian Court.</p>
