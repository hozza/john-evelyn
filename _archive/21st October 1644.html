<p>We took coach to Livorno, through
the Great Duke's new park full of huge cork trees, the
underwood all myrtles, among which were many buffaloes
feeding, a kind of wild ox, short nose with horns reversed;
those who work with them command them, as
our bearwards do the bears, with a ring through the
nose, and a cord. Much of this park, as well as a great
part of the country about it, is very fenny, and the air
very bad.</p>

<p>Leghorn is the prime port belonging to all the Duke's
territories; heretofore a very obscure town, but since
Duke Ferdinand has strongly fortified it (after the modern
way), drained the marshes by cutting a channel
thence to Pisa navigable sixteen miles, and has raised a
Mole, emulating that at Genoa, to secure the shipping,
it is become a place of great receipt; it has also a place
for the galleys, where they lie safe. Before the sea is
an ample piazza for the market, where are the statues
in copper of the four slaves, much exceeding the life for
proportion, and, in the judgment of most artists, one of
the best pieces of modern work. Here, especially in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
piazza, is such a concourse of slaves, Turks, Moors, and
other nations, that the number and confusion is prodigious;
some buying, others selling, others drinking, others
playing, some working, others sleeping, fighting, singing,
weeping, all nearly naked, and miserably chained. Here
was a tent, where any idle fellow might stake his liberty
against a few crowns, at dice, or other hazard; and,
if he lost, he was immediately chained and led away to
the galleys, where he was to serve a term of years, but
from whence they seldom returned; many sottish persons,
in a drunken bravado, would try their fortune in
this way.</p>

<p>The houses of this neat town are very uniform, and
excellently painted <i>รก fresco</i> on the outer walls, with
representations of many of their victories over the Turks.
The houses, though low on account of the earthquakes
which frequently happen here, (as did one during my
being in Italy), are very well built; the piazza is very
fair and commodious, and, with the church, whose four
columns at the portico are of black marble polished,
gave the first hint to the building both of the church
and piazza in Covent Garden with us, though very imperfectly
pursued.</p>
