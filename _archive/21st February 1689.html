<p>Dr. Burnet preached at St. James's
on the obligation to walk worthy of God's particular and
signal deliverance of the nation and church.</p>

<p>I saw the <span class="smcap">new Queen</span> and <span class="smcap">King</span> proclaimed the very
next day after her coming to Whitehall, Wednesday, 13th
February, with great acclamation and general good reception.
Bonfires, bells, guns, etc. It was believed that
both, especially the Princess, would have shown some
(seeming) reluctance at least, of assuming her father's
crown, and made some apology, testifying by her regret
that he should by his mismanagement necessitate the
nation to so extraordinary a proceeding, which would have
shown very handsomely to the world, and according to
the character given of her piety; consonant also to her
husband's first declaration, that there was no intention of
deposing the King, but of succoring the nation; but nothing
of all this appeared; she came into Whitehall laughing
and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite
transported. She rose early the next morning, and in her
undress, as it was reported, before her women were up,
went about from room to room to see the convenience
of Whitehall; lay in the same bed and apartment where
the late Queen lay, and within a night or two sat down
to play at basset, as the Queen, her predecessor used to
do. She smiled upon and talked to everybody, so that
no change seemed to have taken place at Court since her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
last going away, save that infinite crowds of people
thronged to see her, and that she went to our prayers.
This carriage was censured by many. She seems to be
of a good nature, and that she takes nothing to heart:
while the Prince, her husband, has a thoughtful countenance,
is wonderfully serious and silent, and seems to treat
all persons alike gravely, and to be very intent on affairs:
Holland, Ireland, and France calling for his care.</p>

<p>Divers Bishops and Noblemen are not at all satisfied
with this so sudden assumption of the Crown, without any
previous sending, and offering some conditions to the absent
King; or on his not returning, or not assenting to
those conditions, to have proclaimed him Regent; but
the major part of both Houses prevailed to make them
King and Queen immediately, and a crown was tempting.
This was opposed and spoken against with such
vehemence by Lord Clarendon (her own uncle), that it
put him by all preferment, which must doubtless have
been as great as could have been given him. My Lord
of Rochester, his brother, overshot himself, by the same
carriage and stiffness, which their friends thought they
might have well spared when they saw how it was like
to be overruled, and that it had been sufficient to have
declared their dissent with less passion, acquiescing in
due time.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of the rest,
on scruple of conscience and to salve the oaths they had
taken, entered their protests and hung off, especially the
Archbishop, who had not all this while so much as appeared
out of Lambeth. This occasioned the wonder of
many who observed with what zeal they contributed to
the Prince's expedition, and all the while also rejecting
any proposals of sending again to the absent King; that
they should now raise scruples, and such as created
much division among the people, greatly rejoicing the
old courtiers, and especially the Papists.</p>

<p>Another objection was, the invalidity of what was done
by a convention only, and the as yet unabrogated laws;
this drew them to make themselves on the 22d [February]
a Parliament, the new King passing the act with
the crown on his head. The lawyers disputed, but necessity
prevailed, the government requiring a speedy
settlement.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>Innumerable were the crowds, who solicited for, and
expected offices; most of the old ones were turned out.
Two or three white staves were disposed of some days
before, as Lord Steward, to the Earl of Devonshire;
Treasurer of the household, to Lord Newport; Lord
Chamberlain to the King, to my Lord of Dorset; but
there were as yet none in offices of the civil government
save the Marquis of Halifax as Privy Seal. A
council of thirty was chosen, Lord Derby president, but
neither Chancellor nor Judges were yet declared, the
new Great Seal not yet finished.</p>
