<p>I gave God thanks for his mercy
and protection the past year, and made up my accounts,
which came this year to 7,015 livres, near £600 sterling.</p>

<p>1st January, 1650-51. I wrote to my brother at Wotton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
about his garden and fountains. After evening prayer,
Mr. Wainsford called on me: he had long been Consul at
Aleppo, and told me many strange things of those countries,
the Arabs especially.</p>
