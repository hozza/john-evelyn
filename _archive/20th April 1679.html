<p><span class="smcap">Easter day.</span> Our vicar preached exceedingly
well on 1 Cor. v. 7. The Holy Communion followed,
at which I and my daughter, Mary (now about
fourteen years old), received for the first time. The Lord
Jesus continue his grace unto her, and improve this
blessed beginning!</p>
