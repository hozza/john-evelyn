<p>I went to visit the Bishop of Lincoln,
when, among other things, he told me that one Dr.
Chaplin, of University College in Oxford, was the person
who wrote the "Whole Duty of Man"; that he used
to read it to his pupil, and communicated it to Dr.
Sterne, afterward Archbishop of York, but would never
suffer any of his pupils to have a copy of it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>
