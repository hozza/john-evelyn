<p>I went to see Dr. Sloane's curiosities,
being an universal collection of the natural productions
of Jamaica, consisting of plants, fruits, corals, minerals,
stones, earth, shells, animals, and insects, collected with
great judgment; several folios of dried plants, and one
which had about 80 several sorts of ferns, and another
of grasses; the Jamaica pepper, in branch, leaves, flower,
fruit, etc. This collection,<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_76_76">76</a> with his Journal and other
philosophical and natural discourses and observations,
indeed very copious and extraordinary, sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
furnish a history of that island, to which I encouraged
him.</p>
