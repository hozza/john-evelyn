<p>We all dined at that most obliging
and universally-curious Dr. Wilkins's, at Wadham College.
He was the first who showed me the transparent apiaries,
which he had built like castles and palaces, and so ordered
them one upon another, as to take the honey without
destroying the bees. These were adorned with a
variety of dials, little statues, vanes, etc.; and, he was
so abundantly civil, finding me pleased with them, to
present me with one of the hives which he had empty,
and which I afterward had in my garden at Sayes Court,
where it continued many years, and which his Majesty
came on purpose to see and contemplate with much satisfaction.
He had also contrived a hollow statue, which
gave a voice and uttered words by a long, concealed pipe
that went to its mouth,<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_49_49">49</a> while one speaks through it at
a good distance. He had, above in his lodgings and gallery,
variety of shadows, dials, perspectives, and many
other artificial, mathematical, and magical curiosities, a
waywiser, a thermometer, a monstrous magnet, conic,
and other sections, a balance on a demi-circle; most of
them of his own, and that prodigious young scholar Mr.
Christopher Wren, who presented me with a piece of
white marble, which he had stained with a lively red,
very deep, as beautiful as if it had been natural.</p>

<p>Thus satisfied with the civilities of Oxford, we left it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
dining at Farringdon, a town which had been newly
fired during the wars; and, passing near the seat of Sir
Walter Pye, we came to Cadenham.</p>
