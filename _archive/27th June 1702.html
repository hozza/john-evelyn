<p>I went to Wotton with my family
for the rest of the summer, and my son-in-law, Draper,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
with his family, came to stay with us, his house at Addiscombe
being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty. Most of the new Parliament were chosen
of Church of England principles, against the peevish
party. The Queen was magnificently entertained at Oxford
and all the towns she passed through on her way to
Bath.</p>
