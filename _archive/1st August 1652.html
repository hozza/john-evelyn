<p>Came old Jerome Lennier, of Greenwich,
a man skilled in painting and music, and another
rare musician, called Mell. I went to see his collection
of pictures, especially those of Julio Romano, which surely
had been the King's, and an Egyptian figure, etc. There
were also excellent things of Polydore, Guido, Raphael,
and Tintoretto. Lennier had been a domestic of Queen
Elizabeth, and showed me her head, an intaglio in a rare
sardonyx, cut by a famous Italian, which he assured me
was exceedingly like her.</p>
