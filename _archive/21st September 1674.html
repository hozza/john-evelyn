<p>I went to see the great loss that
Lord Arlington had sustained by fire at Goring House, this
night consumed to the ground, with exceeding loss of
hangings, plate, rare pictures, and cabinets; hardly anything
was saved of the best and most princely furniture
that any subject had in England. My lord and lady were
both absent at the Bath.</p>
