<p>I dined at Lord Clarendon's, it being
his lady's wedding day, when about three in the afternoon
there was an unusual and violent storm of thunder,
rain, and wind; many boats on the Thames were overwhelmed,
and such was the impetuosity of the wind as
to carry up the waves in pillars and spouts most dreadful
to behold, rooting up trees and ruining some
houses. The Countess of Sunderland afterward told me
that it extended as far as Althorpe at the very time,
which is seventy miles from London. It did no
harm at Deptford, but at Greenwich it did much mischief.</p>
