<p>I sailed this morning with his
Majesty in one of his yachts (or pleasure boats), vessels
not known among us till the Dutch East India Company
presented that curious piece to the King; being very excellent
sailing vessels. It was on a wager between his
other new pleasure boat, built frigate-like, and one of
the Duke of York's; the wager £100; the race from
Greenwich to Gravesend and back. The King lost it
going, the wind being contrary, but saved stakes in returning.
There were divers noble persons and lords on
board, his Majesty sometimes steering himself. His
barge and kitchen boat attended. I brake fast this
morning with the King at return in his smaller vessel,
he being pleased to take me and only four more, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
were noblemen, with him; but dined in his yacht, where
we all ate together with his Majesty. In this passage
he was pleased to discourse to me about my book inveighing
against the nuisance of the smoke of London,
and proposing expedients how, by removing those particulars
I mentioned, it might be reformed; commanding
me to prepare a Bill against the next session of
Parliament, being, as he said, resolved to have something
done in it. Then he discoursed to me of the improvement
of gardens and buildings, now very rare in England
comparatively to other countries. He then commanded
me to draw up the matter of fact happening at the
bloody encounter which then had newly happened between
the French and Spanish Ambassadors near the
Tower, contending for precedency, at the reception of the
Swedish Ambassador; giving me orders to consult Sir
William Compton, Master of the Ordnance, to inform
me of what he knew of it, and with his favorite, Sir
Charles Berkeley, captain of the Duke's life guard, then
present with his troop and three foot companies; with
some other reflections and instructions, to be prepared
with a declaration to take off the reports which went
about of his Majesty's partiality in the affairs, and of
his officers' and spectators' rudeness while the conflict
lasted. So I came home that night, and went next morning
to London, where from the officers of the Tower, Sir
William Compton, Sir Charles Berkeley, and others who
were attending at this meeting of the Ambassadors three
days before, having collected what I could, I drew up a
Narrative in vindication of his Majesty, and the carriage
of his officers and standers-by.</p>

<p>On Thursday his Majesty sent one of the pages of the
back stairs for me to wait on him with my papers, in
his cabinet where was present only Sir Henry Bennett
(Privy-Purse), when beginning to read to his Majesty
what I had drawn up, by the time I had read half a
page, came in Mr. Secretary Morice with a large paper,
desiring to speak with his Majesty, who told him he was
now very busy, and therefore ordered him to come again
some other time; the Secretary replied that what he had
in his hand was of extraordinary importance. So the
King rose up, and, commanding me to stay, went aside
to a corner of the room with the Secretary; after a while,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
the Secretary being dispatched, his Majesty returning to
me at the table, a letter was brought him from Madame
out of France;<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_68_68">68</a> this he read and then bid me proceed
from where I left off. This I did till I had ended all
the narrative, to his Majesty's great satisfaction; and,
after I had inserted one or two more clauses, in which
his Majesty instructed me, commanded that it should
that night be sent to the posthouse, directed to the Lord
Ambassador at Paris (the Earl of St. Alban's), and then
at leisure to prepare him a copy, which he would publish.
This I did, and immediately sent my papers to the Secretary
of State, with his Majesty's express command of
dispatching them that night for France. Before I went
out of the King's closet, he called me back to show me
some ivory statues, and other curiosities that I had not
seen before.</p>
