<p>Dr. Lancaster, the new Vicar of
St. Martin's, preached.</p>

<p>A signal robbery in Hertfordshire of the tax money
bringing out of the north toward London. They were
set upon by several desperate persons, who dismounted
and stopped all travelers on the road, and guarding them
in a field, when the exploit was done, and the treasure
taken, they killed all the horses of those whom they
stayed, to hinder pursuit, being sixteen horses. They then
dismissed those that they had dismounted.</p>
