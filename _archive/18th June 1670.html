<p>Dined at Goring House, whither my
Lord Arlington carried me from Whitehall with the Marquis
of Worcester; there, we found Lord Sandwich, Viscount
Stafford,<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18_18">18</a> the Lieutenant of the Tower, and others.
After dinner, my Lord communicated to me his Majesty's
desire that I would engage to write the history of
our late war with the Hollanders, which I had hitherto
declined; this I found was ill taken, and that I should
disoblige his Majesty, who had made choice of me to do
him this service, and, if I would undertake it, I should
have all the assistance the Secretary's office and others
could give me, with other encouragements, which I could
not decently refuse.</p>

<p>Lord Stafford rose from the table, in some disorder,
because there were roses stuck about the fruit when the
dessert was set on the table; such an antipathy, it seems,
he had to them as once Lady Selenger also had, and to
that degree that, as Sir Kenelm Digby tells us, laying
but a rose upon her cheek when she was asleep, it
raised a blister: but Sir Kenelm was a teller of strange
things.</p>
