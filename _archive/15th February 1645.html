<p>Mr. Henshaw and I walked by
the Tiber, and visited the Stola Tybertina (now St. Bartholomew's),
formerly cut in the shape of a ship, and
wharfed with marble, in which a lofty obelisk represented
the mast. In the church of St. Bartholomew is
the body of the Apostle. Here are the ruins of the Temple
of Æsculapius, now converted into a stately hospital and
a pretty convent. Opposite to it, is the convent and church
of St. John Calabita, where I saw nothing remarkable, save
an old broken altar. Here was the Temple of Fortuna
Virilis. Hence, we went to a cupola, now a church,
formerly dedicated to the sun. Opposite to it, Santa
Maria Schola Græca, where formerly that tongue was
taught; said to be the second church dedicated in Rome
to the Blessed Virgin; bearing also the title of a Cardinalate.
Behind this stands the great altar of Hercules,
much demolished. Near this, being at the foot of Mount
Aventine, are the Pope's salt houses. Ascending the hill,
we came to St. Sabina, an ancient fabric, formerly sacred
to Diana; there, in a chapel, is an admirable picture,
the work of Livia Fontana, set about with columns of
alabaster, and in the middle of the church is a stone,
cast, as they report, by the Devil at St. Dominic, while
he was at mass. Hence, we traveled toward a heap of
rubbish, called the Marmorata, on the bank of the Tiber,
a magazine of stones; and near which formerly stood a
triumphal arch, in honor of Horatius vanquishing the
Tuscans. The ruins of the bridge yet appear.</p>

<p>We were now got to Mons Testaceus, a heap of potsherds,
almost 200 feet high, thought to have been thrown
there and amassed by the subjects of the Commonwealth
bringing their tribute in earthen vessels, others (more
probably) that it was a quarter of the town where pot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>ters
lived; at the summit Rome affords a noble prospect.
Before it is a spacious green, called the Hippodrome,
where Olympic games were celebrated, and the people
mustered, as in our London Artillery-Ground. Going
hence, to the old wall of the city, we much admired the
pyramid, or tomb, of Caius Cestius, of white marble,
one of the most ancient entire monuments, inserted in the
wall, with this inscription:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>C. Cestius L. F. Pob. Epulo (an order of priests) Pr. Tr. pl.
VII. Vir. Epulonum.</i>"</p>

<p>And a little beneath:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Opus absolutum ex testamento diebus CCCXXX. arbitratu.
Ponti P. F. Cla. Melæ Heredis et Pothi L.</i>"</p>

<p>At the left hand, is the Port of St. Paul, once Tergemina,
out of which the three Horatii passed to encounter
the Curiatii of Albano. Hence, bending homeward by St.
Saba, by Antoninus's baths (which we entered), is the
marble sepulchre of Vespasian. The thickness of the
walls and the stately ruins show the enormous magnitude
of these baths. Passing by a corner of the Circus
Maximus, we viewed the place where stood the Septizonium,
demolished by Sextus V., for fear of its falling.
Going by Mons Cœlius, we beheld the devotions of St.
Maria in Naviculâ, so named from a ship carved out in
white marble standing on a pedestal before it, supposed to
be the vow of one escaped from shipwreck. It has a
glorious front to the street. Adjoining to this are the
Hortii Mathæi, which only of all the places about the
city I omitted visiting, though I was told inferior to no
garden in Rome for statues, ancient monuments, aviaries,
fountains, groves, and especially a noble obelisk, and
maintained in beauty at an expense of 6,000 crowns
yearly, which, if not expended to keep up its beauty,
forfeits the possession of a greater revenue to another
family: so curious are they in their villas and places of
pleasure, even to excess.</p>

<p>The next day, we went to the once famous Circus Caracalla,
in the midst of which there now lay prostrate one
of the most stately and ancient obelisks, full of Egyptian
hieroglyphics. It was broken into four pieces, when overthrown
by the Barbarians, and would have been purchased
and transported into England by the magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Thomas Earl of Arundel, could it have been well removed
to the sea. This is since set together and placed
on the stupendous artificial rock made by Innocent X.,
and serving for a fountain in Piazza Navona, the work
of Bernini, the Pope's architect. Near this is the sepulchre
of Metellus, of massy stone, pretty entire, now
called Capo di Bovo. Hence, to a small oratory, named
"<i>Domine, quo vadis</i>"; where the tradition is, that our
Blessed Savior met St. Peter as he fled, and turned him
back again.</p>

<p>St. Sebastian's was the next, a mean structure (the
<i>facciáta</i> <a id="tn_png_191"></a><!--TN: Round bracket added after "excepted"-->excepted), but is venerable, especially for the
relics and grots, in which lie the ashes of many holy
men. Here is kept the pontifical chair sprinkled with
the blood of Pope Stephen, to which great devotion is
paid; also a well full of martyrs' bones, and the sepulchre
of St. Sebastian, with one of the arrows (used in
shooting him). These are preserved by the Fulgentine
Monks, who have here their monastery, and who led us down
into a grotto which they affirmed went divers furlongs
under ground; the sides, or walls which we passed were
filled with bones and dead bodies, laid (as it were) on
shelves, whereof some were shut up with broad stones
and now and then a cross, or a palm, cut in them. At
the end of some of these subterranean passages, were
square rooms with altars in them, said to have been the
receptacles of primitive Christians, in the times of persecution,
nor seems it improbable.</p>
