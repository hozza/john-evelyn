<p>I went about to view the city,
which is well built of stone, on the side of the Loire.
About the middle of the river is an island, full of
walks and fair trees, with some houses. This is contiguous
to the town by a stately stone bridge, reaching
to the opposite suburbs, built likewise on the edge
of a hill, from whence is a beautiful prospect. At one
of the extremes of the bridge are strong towers, and
about the middle, on one side, is the statue of the
Virgin Mary, or Pieta, with the dead Christ in her
lap, as big as the life. At one side of the cross, kneels
Charles VII., armed, and at the other Joan d'Arc,
armed also like a cavalier, with boots and spurs, her
hair disheveled, as the deliveress of the town from our
countrymen, when they besieged it. The figures are
all cast in copper, with a pedestal full of inscriptions, as
well as a fair column joining it, which is all adorned
with fleurs-de-lis and a crucifix, with two saints proceeding
(as it were) from two branches out of its <a id="tn_png_093"></a><!--TN: Period added after "capital"-->capital.
The inscriptions on the cross are in Latin: "<i>Mors Christi in
cruce nos á contagione, labis et æternorum morborum sanavit</i>."
On the pedestal: "<i>Rex in hoc signo hostes profligavit,
et Johanna Virgo Aureliam obsidio liberavit. Non diu
ab impiis diruta, restituta sunt hoc anno D'ni 1578. Jean
Buret, m. f.</i>"—"<i>Octannoque Galliam servitute Britannicâ
liberavit. A Domino factum est illud, et est mirabile in
oculis nostris; in quorum memorià hæc nostræ fidei Insignia</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
To this is made an annual procession on 12th of May,
mass being sung before it, attended with great ceremony
and concourse of people. The wine of this place
is so strong, that the King's cup bearers are, as I was
assured, sworn never to give the King any of it: but it
is a very noble liquor, and much of it transported
into other countries. The town is much frequented by
strangers, especially Germans, for the great purity of
the language here spoken, as well as for divers other
privileges, and the University, which causes the English
to make no long sojourn here, except such as can
drink and debauch. The city stands in the county of
Bealse (Blaisois); was once styled a Kingdom, afterward
a Duchy, as at present, belonging to the second
son of France. Many Councils have been held here,
and some Kings crowned. The University is very ancient,
divided now by the students into that of four
nations, French, High Dutch, Normans, and Picardines,
who have each their respective protectors, several officers,
treasurers, consuls, seals, etc. There are in it two
reasonable fair public libraries, whence one may borrow
a book to one's chamber, giving but a note under
hand, which is an extraordinary custom, and a confidence
that has cost many libraries dear. The first
church I went to visit was St. Croix; it has been a
stately fabric, but now much ruined by the late civil
wars. They report the tower of it to have been the
highest in France. There is the beginning of a fair
reparation. About this cathedral there is a very spacious
cemetery. The townhouse is also very nobly
built, with a high tower to it. The market place and
streets, some whereof are deliciously planted with limes,
are ample and straight, so well paved with a kind of
pebble, that I have not seen a neater town in France.
In fine, this city was by Francis I. esteemed the most
agreeable of his vast dominions.</p>
