<p>Came news of Monmouth's utter defeat,
and the next day of his being taken by Sir William
Portman and Lord Lumley with the militia of their
counties. It seems the Horse, commanded by Lord
Grey, being newly raised and undisciplined, were not to
be brought in so short a time to endure the fire, which
exposed the Foot to the King's, so as when Monmouth
had led the Foot in great silence and order, thinking to
surprise Lieutenant-General Lord Feversham newly encamped,
and given him a smart charge, interchanging
both great and small shot, the Horse, breaking their own
ranks, Monmouth gave it over, and fled with Grey, leaving
their party to be cut in pieces to the number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
2,000. The whole number reported to be above 8,000; the
King's but 2,700. The slain were most of them <span class="smcap">Mendip-miners</span>,
who did great execution with their tools, and
sold their lives very dearly, while their leaders flying
were pursued and taken the next morning, not far from
one another. Monmouth had gone sixteen miles on foot,
changing his habit for a poor coat, and was found by
Lord Lumley in a dry ditch covered with fern-brakes,
but without sword, pistol, or any weapon, and so might
have passed for some countryman, his beard being grown
so long and so gray as hardly to be known, had not his
George discovered him, which was found in his pocket.
It is said he trembled exceedingly all over, not able to
speak. Grey was taken not far from him. Most of his
party were Anabaptists and poor cloth workers of the
country, no gentlemen of account being come in to him.
The arch-<i>boutefeu</i>, Ferguson, Matthews, etc., were not yet
found. The Â£5,000 to be given to whoever should bring
Monmouth in, was to be distributed among the militia
by agreement between Sir William Portman and Lord
Lumley. The battle ended, some words, first in jest,
then in passion, passed between Sherrington Talbot (a
worthy gentleman, son to Sir John Talbot, and who had
behaved himself very handsomely) and one Captain Love,
both commanders of the militia, as to whose soldiers
fought best, both drawing their swords and passing at one
another. Sherrington was wounded to death on the spot,
to the great regret of those who knew him. He was Sir
John's only son.</p>
