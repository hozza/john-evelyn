<p>About noon we entered the city
of Naples, alighting at the Three Kings, where we found
the most plentiful fare all the time we were in Naples.
Provisions are wonderfully cheap; we seldom sat down to
fewer than eighteen or twenty dishes of exquisite meat
and fruits.</p>

<p>The morrow after our arrival, in the afternoon, we
hired a coach to carry us about the town. First, we went
to the castle of St. Elmo, built on a very high rock,
whence we had an entire prospect of the whole city,
which lies in shape of a theatre upon the sea-brink, with
all the circumjacent islands, as far as Capreæ, famous
for the debauched recesses of Tiberius. This fort is
the bridle of the whole city, and was well stored and
garrisoned with native Spaniards. The strangeness of
the precipice and rareness of the prospect of so many
magnificent and stately palaces, churches, and monasteries,
with the Arsenal, the Mole, and Mount Vesuvius
in the distance, all in full command of the eye, make it
one of the richest landscapes in the world.</p>

<p>Hence, we descended to another strong castle, called
Il Castello Nuovo, which protects the shore; but they
would by no entreaty permit us to go in; the outward
defense seems to consist but in four towers, very high,
and an exceeding deep graff, with thick walls. Opposite
to this is the tower of St. Vincent, which is also
very strong.</p>

<p>Then we went to the very noble palace of the Viceroy,
partly old, and part of a newer work; but we did
not stay long here. Toward the evening, we took the
air upon the Mole, a street on the rampart, or bank,
raised in the sea for security of their galleys in port,
built as that of Genoa. Here I observed a rich fountain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
in the middle of the piazza, and adorned with divers rare
statues of copper, representing the Sirens, or Deities of
the Parthenope, spouting large streams of water into an
ample shell, all of cast metal, and of great cost. This
stands at the entrance of the Mole, where we met many
of the nobility both on horseback and in their coaches
to take the fresco from the sea, as the manner is, it being
in the most advantageous quarter for good air, delight
and prospect. Here we saw divers goodly horses
who handsomely become their riders, the Neapolitan gentlemen.
This Mole is about 500 paces in length, and
paved with a square hewn stone. From the Mole, we
ascend to a church of great antiquity, formerly sacred to
Castor and Pollux, as the Greek letters carved on the
architrave and the busts of their two statues testify. It
is now converted into a stately oratory by the Theatines.</p>

<p>The Cathedral is a most magnificent pile, and except
St. Peter's in Rome, Naples exceeds all cities for stately
churches and monasteries. We were told that this day
the blood of St. Januarius and his head should be exposed,
and so we found it, but obtained not to see the
miracle of the boiling of this blood. The next we went
to see was St. Peter's, richly adorned, the chapel especially,
where that Apostle said mass, as is testified on the
wall.</p>

<p>After dinner we went to St. Dominic, where they showed
us the crucifix that is reported to have said these words
to St. Thomas, "<i>Benè de me scripsisti, Thoma</i>." Hence, to
the Padri Olivetani, famous for the monument of the
learned Alexander-ab-Alexandro.</p>

<p>We proceeded, the next day, to visit the church of
Santa Maria Maggiore, where we spent much time in surveying
the chapel of Joh. Jov. Pontanus, and in it the
several and excellent sentences and epitaphs on himself,
wife, children, and friends, full of rare wit, and worthy
of recording, as we find them in several writers. In the
same chapel is shown an arm of Titus Livius, with this
epigraph. "<i>Titi Livij brachium quod Anton. Panormita
a Patavinis impetravit, Jo. Jovianus Pontanus multos post
annos hôc in loco ponendum curavit.</i>"</p>

<p>Climbing a steep hill, we came to the monastery and
Church of the Carthusians, from whence is a most goodly
prospect toward the sea and city, the one full of galleys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and ships, the other of stately palaces, churches, monasteries,
castles, gardens, delicious fields and meadows,
Mount Vesuvius smoking, the promontory of Minerva
and Misenum, Capreæ, Prochyta, Ischia, Pausilipum,
Puteoli, and the rest, doubtless one of the most divertissant
and considerable vistas in the world. The church
is most elegantly built; the very pavements of the common
cloister being all laid with variously polished marbles,
richly figured. They showed us a massy cross of
silver, much celebrated for the workmanship and carving,
and said to have been fourteen years in perfecting. The
choir also is of rare art; but above all to be admired, is
the yet unfinished church of the Jesuits, certainly, if accomplished,
not to be equalled in Europe. Hence, we
passed by the Palazzo Caraffii, full of ancient and very
noble statues: also the palace of the Orsini. The next
day, we did little but visit some friends, English merchants,
resident for their negotiation; only this morning
at the Viceroy's Cavalerizza I saw the noblest horses that
I had ever beheld, one of his sons riding the menage
with that address and dexterity as I had never seen anything
approach it.</p>
