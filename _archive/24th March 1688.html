<p>I went with Sir Charles Littleton
to Sheen, a house and estate given him by Lord Brounker;
one who was ever noted for a hard, covetous, vicious
man; but for his worldly craft and skill in gaming few
exceeded him. Coming to die, he bequeathed all his
land, house, furniture, etc., to Sir Charles, to whom he
had no manner of relation, but an ancient friendship contracted
at the famous siege of Colchester, forty years
before. It is a pretty place, with fine gardens, and well
planted, and given to one worthy of them, Sir Charles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
being an honest gentleman and soldier. He is brother
to Sir Henry Littleton of Worcestershire, whose great
estate he is likely to inherit, his brother being without
children. They are descendants of the great lawyer of
that name, and give the same arms and motto. He is
married to one Mrs. Temple, formerly maid of honor to
the late Queen, a beautiful lady, and he has many fine
children, so that none envy his good fortune.</p>

<p>After dinner, we went to see Sir William Temple's
near to it; the most remarkable things are his orangery
and gardens, where the wall-fruit-trees are most exquisitely
nailed and trained, far better than I ever noted.</p>

<p>There are many good pictures, especially of Vandyke's,
in both these houses, and some few statues and small
busts in the latter.</p>

<p>From thence to Kew, to visit Sir Henry Capel's,
whose orangery and <i>myrtetum</i> are most beautiful and
perfectly well kept. He was contriving very high palisadoes
of reeds to shade his oranges during the summer,
and painting those reeds in oil.</p>
