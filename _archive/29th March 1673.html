<p>I carried my son to the Bishop of
Chichester, that learned and pious man, Dr. Peter Gunning,
to be instructed by him before he received the
Holy Sacrament, when he gave him most excellent
advice, which I pray God may influence and remain with
him as long as he lives; and O that I had been so
blessed and instructed, when first I was admitted to that
sacred ordinance!</p>
