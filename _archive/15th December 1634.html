<p>My dear sister, Darcy, departed
this life, being arrived to her 20th year of age; in virtue
advanced beyond her years, or the merit of her husband,
the worst of men. She had been brought to bed the
2d of June before, but the infant died soon after her,
the 24th of December. I was therefore sent for home
the second time, to celebrate the obsequies of my sister;
who was interred in a very honorable manner in our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
dormitory joining to the parish church, where now her
monument stands.</p>

<p>1635. But my dear mother being now dangerously
sick, I was, on the 3d of September following, sent for
to Wotton. Whom I found so far spent, that, all human
assistance failing, she in a most heavenly manner departed
this life upon the 29th of the same month, about
eight in the evening of Michaelmas-day. It was a malignant
fever which took her away, about the 37th of her
age, and 22d of her marriage, to our irreparable loss
and the regret of all that knew her. Certain it is, that
the visible cause of her indisposition proceeded from
grief upon the loss of her daughter, and the infant that
followed it; and it is as certain, that when she perceived
the peril whereto its excess had engaged her, she
strove to compose herself and allay it; but it was too late,
and she was forced to succumb. Therefore summoning all
her children then living (I shall never forget it), she expressed
herself in a manner so heavenly, with instructions
so pious and Christian, as made us strangely sensible of
the extraordinary loss then imminent; after which, embracing
every one of us she gave to each a ring with
her blessing and dismissed us. Then, taking my father
by the hand, she recommended us to his care; and, because
she was extremely zealous for the education of my
younger brother, she requested my father that he might
be sent with me to Lewes; and so having importuned
him that what he designed to bestow on her funeral, he
would rather dispose among the poor, she labored to
compose herself for the blessed change which she now
expected. There was not a servant in the house whom
she did not expressly send for, advise, and infinitely affect
with her counsel. Thus she continued to employ
her intervals, either instructing her relations, or preparing
of herself.</p>

<p>Though her physicians, Dr. Meverell, Dr. Clement,
and Dr. Rand, had given over all hopes of her recovery,
and Sir Sanders Duncombe had tried his celebrated and
famous powder, yet she was many days impairing, and
endured the sharpest conflicts of her sickness with admirable
patience and most Christian resignation, retaining
both her intellectuals and ardent affections for her
dissolution, to the very article of her departure. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
near her dissolution, she laid her hand on every one of
her children; and taking solemn leave of my father, with
elevated heart and eyes, she quietly expired, and resigned
her soul to God. Thus ended that prudent and pious
woman, in the flower of her age, to the inconsolable affliction
of her husband, irreparable loss of her children,
and universal regret of all that knew her. She was
interred, as near as might be, to her daughter Darcy,
the 3d of October, at night, but with no mean ceremony.</p>

<p>It was the 3d of the ensuing November, after my
brother George was gone back to Oxford, ere I returned
to Lewes, when I made way, according to instructions
received of my father, for my brother Richard, who was
sent the 12th after.</p>

<p>1636. This year being extremely dry, the pestilence
much increased in London, and divers parts of England.</p>
