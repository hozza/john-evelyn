<p>I was especially admitted (and,
as I remember, my other brother) into the Middle Temple,
London, though absent, and as yet at school. There
were now large contributions to the distressed Palatinates.</p>

<p>The 10th of December my father sent a servant to
bring us necessaries, and the plague beginning now to
cease, on the 3d of April, 1637, I left school, where,
till about the last year, I have been extremely remiss in
my studies; so as I went to the University rather out of
shame of abiding longer at school, than for any fitness,
as by sad experience I found: which put me to re-learn
all that I had neglected, or but perfunctorily gained.</p>
