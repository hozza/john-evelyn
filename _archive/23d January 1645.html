<p>We went without the walls of the
city to visit St. Paul's, to which place it is said the
Apostle bore his own head after Nero had caused it to
be cut off. The church was founded by the great Constantine;
the main roof is supported by 100 vast columns
of marble, and the Mosaic work of the great arch is
wrought with a very ancient story Aº 440; as is likewise
that of the <i>facciata</i>. The gates are brass, made at Constantinopole
in 1070, as you may read by those Greek verses
engraven on them. The church is near 500 feet long
and 258 in breadth, and has five great aisles joined to it,
on the basis of one of whose columns is this odd title:
"<i>Fl. Eugenius Asellus C. C. Præf. Urbis V. S. I. reparavit</i>."
Here they showed us that miraculous Crucifix which they
say spake to St. Bridget: and, just before the Ciborio,
stand two excellent statues. Here are buried part of the
bodies of St. Paul and St. Peter. The pavement is richly
interwoven with precious Oriental marbles about the high
altar, where are also four excellent paintings, whereof
one, representing the stoning of St. Stephen, is by the
hand of a Bolognian lady, named Lavinia. The tabernacle
on this altar is of excellent architecture, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
pictures in the Chapel del Sacramento are of Lanfranco.
Divers other relics there be also in this venerable church,
as a part of St. Anna; the head of the Woman of Samaria;
the chain which bound St. Paul, and the <i>eculeus</i> used
in tormenting the primitive Christians. The church
stands in the Via Ositensis, about a mile from the walls
of the city, separated from many buildings near it except
the Trie Fontana, to which (leaving our coach) we walked,
going over the mountain or little rising, upon which story
says a hundred seventy and four thousand Christians had
been martyred by Maximianus, Dioclesian, and other
bloody tyrants. On this stand St. Vincent's and St.
Anastasius; likewise the Church of St. Maria Scala del
Cielo, in whose Tribuna is a very fair Mosaic work. The
Church of the Trie Fontana (as they are called) is perfectly
well built, though but small (whereas that of St.
Paul is but Gothic), having a noble cupola in the middle;
in this they show the pillar to which St. Paul was
bound, when his head was cut off, and from whence it
made three prodigious leaps, where there immediately
broke out the three remaining fountains, which give denomination
to this church. The waters are reported to
be medicinal: over each is erected an altar and a chained
ladle, for better tasting of the waters. That most excellent
picture of St. Peter's Crucifixion is of Guido.</p>
