<p>Came to dine with me the Earl of
Lauderdale, his Majesty's great favorite, and Secretary of
Scotland; the Earl of Teviot; my Lord Viscount Brouncker,
President of the Royal Society; Dr. Wilkins, Dean of
Ripon; Sir Robert Murray, and Mr.Â Hooke, Curator to
the Society.</p>

<p>This spring I planted the Home field and West field
about Sayes Court with elms, being the same year that
the elms were planted by his Majesty in Greenwich
Park.</p>
