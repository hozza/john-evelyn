<p>I was at a conference of the Lords
and Commons in the Painted Chamber, on a difference
about imprisoning some of their members; and on the
3d, at another conference, when the Lords accused the
Commons for their transcendent misbehavior, breach of
privilege, Magna Charta, subversion of government, and
other high, provoking, and diminishing expressions, showing
what duties and subjection they owed to the Lords
in Parliament, by record of Henry IV. This was likely
to create a notable disturbance.</p>
