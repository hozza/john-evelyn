<p>We passed next through Warwick,
and saw the castle, the dwelling house of the Lord Brook,
and the furniture noble. It is built on an eminent rock
which gives prospect into a most goodly green, a woody
and plentifully watered country; the river running so
delightfully under it, that it may pass for one of the
most surprising seats one should meet with. The gardens
are prettily disposed; but might be much improved. Here
they showed us Sir Guy's great two-handed sword, staff,
horse-arms, pot, and other relics of that famous knight-errant.
Warwick is a fair old town, and hath one church
full of ancient monuments.</p>

<p>Having viewed these, I went to visit my worthy friend,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Sir H. Puckering, at the Abbey, and though a melancholy
old seat, yet in a rich soil.</p>

<p>Hence to Sir Guy's grot, where they say he did his
penances, and died. It is a squalid den made in the rock,
crowned yet with venerable oaks and looking on a goodly
stream, so as, were it improved as it might be, it were
capable of being made a most romantic and pleasant place.
Near this, we were showed his chapel and gigantic statue
hewn out of the solid rock, out of which there are likewise
divers other caves cut, and some very capacious.</p>

<p>The next place to Coventry. The cross is remarkable
for Gothic work and rich gilding, comparable to any I
had ever seen, except that of Cheapside in London, now
demolished. This city has many handsome churches, a
beautiful wall, a fair free school and library to it; the
streets full of great shops, clean and well paved. At
going forth the gate, they show us the bone, or rib, of a
wild boar, said to have been killed by Sir Guy, but
which I take to be the chine of a whale.</p>
