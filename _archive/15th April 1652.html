<p>I wrote to the Dean, touching my
buying his library, which was one of the choicest collections
of any private person in England.</p>

<p>The Count de Strade most generously and handsomely
sent me the picture of my wife from Dunkirk, in a large
tin case without any charge. It is of Mr.Â Bourdon, and
is that which has the dog in it, and is to the knees, but
it has been somewhat spoiled by washing it ignorantly
with soapsuds.</p>
