<p>I went to see Dr. Tenison's library
[in St. Martin's].</p>

<p>Monmouth was this day brought to London and examined
before the King, to whom he made great submission,
acknowledged his seduction by Ferguson, the
Scot, whom he named the bloody villain. He was sent
to the Tower, had an interview with his late Duchess,
whom he received coldly, having lived dishonestly with
the Lady Henrietta Wentworth for two years. He obstinately
asserted his conversation with that debauched
woman to be no sin; whereupon, seeing he could not be
persuaded to his last breath, the divines who were sent
to assist him thought not fit to administer the Holy Communion
to him. For the rest of his faults he professed
great sorrow, and so died without any apparent fear. He
would not make use of a cap or other circumstance, but
lying down, bid the fellow to do his office better than to
the late Lord Russell, and gave him gold; but the wretch
made five chops before he had his head off; which so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
incensed the people, that had he not been guarded and
got away, they would have torn him to pieces.</p>

<p>The Duke made no speech on the scaffold (which was
on Tower Hill), but gave a paper containing not above
five or six lines, for the King, in which he disclaims all
title to the Crown, acknowledges that the late King, his
father, had indeed told him he was but his base son, and
so desired his Majesty to be kind to his wife and children.
This relation I had from Dr. Tenison (Rector of St.
Martin's), who, with the Bishops of Ely and Bath and
Wells, were sent to him by his Majesty, and were at the
execution.</p>

<p>Thus ended this quondam Duke, darling of his father
and the ladies, being extremely handsome and adroit, an
excellent soldier and dancer, a favorite of the people, of
an easy nature, debauched by lust; seduced by crafty
knaves, who would have set him up only to make a property,
and taken the opportunity of the King being of
another religion, to gather a party of discontented men.
He failed and perished.</p>

<p>He was a lovely person, had a virtuous and excellent
lady that brought him great riches, and a second dukedom
in Scotland. He was Master of the Horse, General of the
King his father's army, Gentleman of the Bedchamber,
Knight of the Garter, Chancellor of Cambridge, in a word,
had accumulations without end. See what ambition and
want of principles brought him to! He was beheaded on
Tuesday, 14th of July. His mother, whose name was Barlow,
daughter of some very mean creatures, was a beautiful
strumpet, whom I had often seen at Paris; she died
miserably without anything to bury her; yet this Perkin
had been made to believe that the King had married her, a
monstrous and ridiculous forgery! And to satisfy the
world of the iniquity of the report, the King his father
(if his father he really was, for he most resembled one
Sidney who was familiar with his mother) publicly and
most solemnly renounced it, to be so entered in the
Council Book some years since, with all the Privy Councillors'
attestation.<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_60_60">60</a></p>

<p>Had it not pleased God to dissipate this attempt in the
beginning, there would in all appearance have gathered
an irresistible force which would have desperately <a id="tn_png_242"></a><!--TN: "pro ceeded" changed to "proceeded" on Page 229-->proceeded
to the ruin of the Church and Government; so
general was the discontent and expectation of the opportunity.
For my own part, I looked upon this deliverance
as most signal. Such an inundation of fanatics
and men of impious principles must needs have caused
universal disorder, cruelty, injustice, rapine, sacrilege,
and confusion, an unavoidable civil war, and misery without
<a id="tn_png_242a"></a><!--TN: Period added after "end" on Page 229-->end. Blessed be God, the knot was happily broken,
and a fair prospect of tranquillity for the future, if
we reform, be thankful, and make a right use of this
mercy!</p>
