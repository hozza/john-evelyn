<p>My daughter Elizabeth died of the
smallpox, soon after having married a young man,
nephew of Sir John Tippett, Surveyor of the Navy, and
one of the Commissioners. The 30th, she was buried in
the church at Deptford. Thus, in less than six months
were we deprived of two children for our unworthiness
and causes best known to God, whom I beseech from
the bottom of my heart that he will give us grace to
make that right use of all these chastisements, that we
may become better, and entirely submit in all things to
his infinitely wise disposal. Amen!</p>
