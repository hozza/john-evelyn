<p>A full appearance at the Council.
The matter in debate was, whether we should send a
deputy to New England, requiring them of the Massachusetts
to restore such to their limits and respective
possessions, as had petitioned the Council; this to be the
open commission only; but, in truth, with secret instructions
to inform us of the condition of those Colonies,
and whether they were of such power, as to be able to
resist his Majesty and declare for themselves as independent
of the Crown, which we were told, and which
of late years made them refractory. Colonel Middleton,
being called in, assured us they might be curbed by a
few of his Majesty's first-rate frigates, to spoil their trade
with the islands; but, though my Lord President was
not satisfied, the rest were, and we did resolve to advise
his Majesty to send Commissioners with a formal commission
for adjusting boundaries, etc., with some other
instructions.</p>

<p>19th August, <a id="tn_png_081"></a><!--TN: Period added after "1671"-->1671. To Council. The letters of Sir
Thomas Modiford were read, giving relation of the exploit
at Panama, which was very brave; they took, burned,
and pillaged the town of vast treasures, but the best of
the booty had been shipped off, and lay at anchor in
the South Sea, so that, after our men had ranged the
country sixty miles about, they went back to Nombre de
Dios, and embarked for Jamaica. Such an action had not
been done since the famous Drake.</p>

<p>I dined at the Hamburg Resident's, and, after dinner,
went to the christening of Sir Samuel Tuke's son,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Charles, at Somerset House, by a Popish priest, and many
odd ceremonies. The godfathers were the King, and Lord
Arundel of Wardour, and godmother, the Countess of
Huntingdon.</p>
