<p>I visited the Jesuits' School, which,
for the fame of their method, I greatly desired to see.
They were divided into four classes, with several inscriptions
over each: as, first, <i>Ad majorem Dei gloriam</i>; over
the second, <i>Princeps diligenti√¶</i>; the third, <i>Imperator
Byzantiorum</i>; over the fourth and uppermost, <i>Imperator
Romanorum</i>. Under these, the scholars and pupils and
their places, or forms with titles and priority according
to their proficiency. Their dormitory and lodgings above
were exceedingly neat. They have a prison for the
offenders and less diligent; and, in an ample court, to
recreate themselves in, is an aviary, and a yard, where
eagles, vultures, foxes, monkeys, and other animals are
kept, to divert the boys withal at their hours of remission.
To this school join the music and mathematical
schools, and lastly a pretty, neat chapel. The great
street is built after the Italian mode, in the middle
whereof is erected a glorious crucifix of white and black
marble, greater than the life. This is a very fair and
noble street, clean, well paved, and sweet to admiration.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>The Oesters house, belonging to the East India Company,
is a stately palace, adorned with more than 300
windows. From hence, walking into the Gun-garden, I
was allowed to see as much of the citadel as is permitted
to strangers. It is a matchless piece of modern
fortification, accommodated with lodgments for the soldiers
and magazines. The graffs, ramparts, and platforms
are stupendous. Returning by the shop of Plantine, I
bought some books, for the namesake only of that famous
printer.</p>

<p>But there was nothing about this city which more ravished
me than those delicious shades and walks of stately
trees, which render the fortified works of the town one
of the sweetest places in Europe; nor did I ever observe
a more quiet, clean, elegantly built and civil place, than
this magnificent and famous city of Antwerp. In the
evening, I was invited to Signor Duerte's, a Portuguese
by nation, an exceeding rich merchant, whose palace I
found to be furnished like a prince's. His three daughters
entertained us with rare music, vocal and instrumental,
which was finished with a handsome collation.
I took leave of the ladies and of sweet Antwerp, as late
as it was, embarking for Brussels on the Scheldt in a
vessel, which delivered us to a second boat (in another
river) drawn or towed by horses. In this passage, we
frequently changed our barge, by reason of the bridges
thwarting our course. Here I observed numerous families
inhabiting their vessels and floating dwellings, so built
and divided by cabins, as few houses on land enjoyed
better accommodation; stored with all sorts of utensils,
neat chambers, a pretty parlor, and kept so sweet, that
nothing could be more refreshing. The rivers on which
they are drawn are very clear and still waters, and pass
through a most pleasant country on both the banks. We
had in our boat a very good ordinary, and excellent company.
The cut is straight as a line for twenty English
miles. What I much admired was, near the midway,
another artificial river, which intersects this at right
angles, but on an eminence of ground, and is carried in
an aqueduct of stone so far above the other as that the
waters neither mingle, nor hinder one another's passage.</p>

<p>We came to a town called Villefrow, where all the
passengers went on shore to wash at a fountain issuing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
out of a pillar, and then came aboard again. On the
margin of this long tract are abundance of shrines and
images, defended from the injuries of the weather by
niches of stone wherein they are placed.</p>
