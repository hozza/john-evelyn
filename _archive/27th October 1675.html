<p>Lord Berkeley coming into Council,
fell down in the gallery at Whitehall, in a fit of
apoplexy, and being carried into my Lord Chamberlain's
lodgings, several famous doctors were employed all that
night, and with much ado he was at last recovered to
some sense, by applying hot fire pans and spirit of amber
to his head; but nothing was found so effectual as cupping
him on the shoulders. It was almost a miraculous
restoration. The next day he was carried to Berkeley
House. This stopped his journey for the present, and
caused my stay in town. He had put all his affairs and
his whole estate in England into my hands during his
intended absence, which though I was very unfit to
undertake, in regard of many businesses which then took
me up, yet, upon the great importunity of my lady and
Mr. Godolphin (to whom I could refuse nothing) I did
take it on me. It seems when he was Deputy in Ireland,
not long before, he had been much wronged by one he
left in trust with his affairs, and therefore wished for
some unmercenary friend who would take that trouble
on him; this was to receive his rents, look after his
houses and tenants, solicit supplies from the Lord Treasurer,
and correspond weekly with him, more than enough
to employ any drudge in England; but what will not
friendship and love make one do?</p>
