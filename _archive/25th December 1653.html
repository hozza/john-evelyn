<p>Christmas day. No churches, or
public assembly. I was fain to pass the devotions of that
Blessed day with my family at home.</p>

<p>20th January, 1653-54. Come to see my old acquaintance
and the most incomparable player on the Irish harp,
Mr.Â Clark,<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_48_48">48</a> after his travels. He was an excellent musician,
a discreet gentleman, born in Devonshire (as I re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>member).
Such music before or since did I never hear, that
instrument being neglected for its extraordinary difficulty;
but, in my judgment, far superior to the lute itself, or
whatever speaks with strings.</p>
