<p>I gave notice to the Bishop of Rochester
of what Maimburg had published about the
motives of the late Duchess of York's perversion, in his
"History of Calvinism;" and did myself write to the Bishop
of Winchester about it, who being concerned in it, I
urged him to set forth his vindication.</p>
