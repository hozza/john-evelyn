<p>I began to set out the oval garden
at Sayes Court, which was before a rude orchard, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
all the rest one entire field of 100 acres, without any
hedge, except the hither holly hedge joining to the bank
of the mount walk. This was the beginning of all the
succeeding gardens, walks, groves, inclosures, and plantations
there.</p>
