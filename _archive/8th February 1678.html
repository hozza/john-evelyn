<p>Supping at my Lord Chamberlain's
I had a long discourse with the Count de Castel
Mellor, lately Prime Minister in Portugal, who, taking
part with his master, King Alphonso, was banished by
his brother, Don Pedro, now Regent; but had behaved
himself so uncorruptly in all his ministry that, though
he was acquitted, and his estate restored, yet would
they not suffer him to return. He is a very intelligent
and worthy gentleman.</p>
