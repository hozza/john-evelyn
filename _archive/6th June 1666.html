<p>Came Sir Daniel Harvey from the
General and related the dreadful encounter, on which his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Majesty commanded me to dispatch an extraordinary
physician and more chirurgeons. It was on the solemn
Fast-day when the news came; his Majesty being in the
chapel made a sudden stop to hear the relation, which
being with much advantage on our side, his Majesty commanded
that public thanks should immediately be given
as for a victory. The Dean of the chapel going down to
give notice of it to the other Dean officiating; and notice
was likewise sent to St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey.
But this was no sooner over, than news came that our
loss was very great both in ships and men; that the
Prince frigate was burnt, and as noble a vessel of ninety
brass guns lost; and the taking of Sir George Ayscue,
and exceeding shattering of both fleets; so as both being
obstinate, both parted rather for want of ammunition and
tackle than courage; our General retreating like a lion;
which exceedingly abated of our former joy. There were,
however, orders given for bonfires and bells; but, God
knows, it was rather a deliverance than a triumph. So
much it pleased God to humble our late overconfidence
that nothing could withstand the Duke of Albemarle,
who, in good truth, made too forward a reckoning of his
success now, because he had once beaten the Dutch in
another quarrel; and being ambitious to outdo the Earl of
Sandwich, whom he had prejudicated as deficient in courage.</p>
