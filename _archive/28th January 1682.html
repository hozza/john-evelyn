<p>Mr. Pepys, late Secretary to the
Admiralty, showed me a large folio containing the whole
mechanic part and art of building royal ships and men-of-war,
made by Sir Anthony Dean, being so accurate a
piece from the very keel to the lead block, rigging, guns,
victualing, manning, and even to every individual pin
and nail, in a method so astonishing and curious, with a
draught, both geometrical and in perspective, and several
sections, that I do not think the world can show the like.
I esteem this book as an extraordinary jewel.</p>
