<p>We went to the Portico where
the famous statue of Judith and Holofernes stands, also
the Medusa, all of copper; but what is most admirable
is the Rape of a Sabine, with another man under foot,
the confusion and turning of whose limbs is most admirable.
It is of one entire marble, the work of John di
Bologna, and is most stupendous; this stands directly
against the great piazza, where, to adorn one fountain,
are erected four marble statues and eight of brass, representing
Neptune and his family of sea gods, of a Colossean
magnitude, with four sea horses, in Parian marble
of Lamedrati, in the midst of a very great basin: a work,
I think, hardly to be paralleled. Here is also the famous
statue of David, by M. Angelo; Hercules and Cacus, by
Baccio Bandinelli; the Perseus, in copper, by Benevento,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and the Judith of Donatelli, which stand publicly before
the old Palace with the Centaur of Bologna, huge Colossean
figures. Near this stand Cosmo di Medicis on horseback,
in brass on a pedestal of marble, and four copper
bassorelievos by John di Bologna, with divers inscriptions;
the Ferdinand the First, on horseback, is of Pietro
Tacca. The brazen boar, which serves for another public
fountain, is admirable.</p>

<p>After dinner, we went to the Church of the Annunciata,
where the Duke and his Court were at their devotions,
being a place of extraordinary repute for sanctity:
for here is a shrine that does great miracles, [proved] by
innumerable votive tablets, etc., covering almost the walls
of the whole church. This is the image of Gabriel, who
saluted the Blessed Virgin, and which the artist finished so
well, that he was in despair of performing the Virgin's
face so well; whereupon it was miraculously done for him
while he slept; but others say it was painted by St. Luke
himself. Whoever it was, infinite is the devotion of both
sexes to it. The altar is set off with four columns of
oriental alabaster, and lighted by thirty great silver lamps.
There are innumerable other pictures by rare masters.
Our Savior's Passion in brass tables inserted in marble,
is the work of John di Bologna and Baccio Bandinelli.</p>

<p>To this church joins a convent, whose cloister is painted
in <i>fresco</i> very rarely. There is also near it an hospital for
1,000 persons, with nurse-children, and several other charitable
accommodations.</p>

<p>At the Duke's Cavalerizza, the Prince has a stable of the
finest horses of all countries, Arabs, Turks, Barbs, Gennets,
English, etc., which are continually exercised in the
<i>manège</i>.</p>

<p>Near this is a place where are kept several wild beasts,
as wolves, cats, bears, tigers, and lions. They are loose in
a deep walled court, and therefore to be seen with more
pleasure than those at the Tower of London, in their
grates. One of the lions leaped to a surprising height,
to catch a joint of mutton which I caused to be hung
down.</p>

There are many plain brick towers erected for defense,
when this was a free state. The highest is called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the Mangio, standing at the foot of the piazza which we
went first to see after our arrival. At the entrance of
this tower is a chapel open toward the piazza, of marble
well adorned with sculpture.</p>

<p>On the other side is the Signoria, or Court of Justice,
well built <i>a la moderna</i>, of brick; indeed the bricks of
Sienna are so well made, that they look almost as well
as porphyry itself, having a kind of natural polish.</p>

<p>In the Senate-house is a very fair Hall where they
sometimes entertain the people with public shows and
operas, as they call them. Toward the left are the statues
of Romulus and Remus with the wolf, all of brass,
placed on a column of ophite stone, which they report
was brought from the renowned Ephesian Temple. These
ensigns being the arms of the town, are set up in divers
of the streets and public ways both within and far without
the city.</p>

<p>The piazza compasses the facciáta of the court and
chapel, and, being made with descending steps, much resembles
the figure of an escalop shell. The white ranges
of pavement, intermixed with the excellent bricks above
mentioned, with which the town is generally well paved,
render it very clean. About this market place (for so it
is) are many fair palaces, though not built with excess
of elegance. There stands an arch, the work of Baltazzar
di Sienna, built with wonderful ingenuity, so that it is
not easy to conceive how it is supported, yet it has some
imperceptible contiguations, which do not betray themselves
easily to the eye. On the edge of the piazza is a
goodly fountain beautified with statues, the water issuing
out of the wolves' mouths, being the work of Jacobo
Quercei, a famous artist. There are divers other public
fountains in the city, of good design.</p>

<p>After this we walked to the Sapienza, which is the
University, or rather College, where the high Germans
enjoy many particular privileges when they addict themselves
to the civil law: and indeed this place has produced
many excellent scholars, besides those three Popes, Alexander,
Pius II., and III., of that name, the learned Æneas
Sylvius; and both were of the ancient house of the Piccolomini.</p>

<p>The chief street is called Strada Romana, in which
Pius II. has built a most stately palace of square stone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
with an incomparable portico joining near to it. The
town is commanded by a castle which hath four bastions
and a garrison of soldiers. Near it is a list to ride horses
in, much frequented by the gallants in summer.</p>

<p>Not far from hence is the Church and Convent of the
Dominicans, where in the chapel of St. Catherine of
Sienna they show her head, the rest of her body being
translated to Rome. The Duomo, or Cathedral, both
without and within, is of large square stones of black and
white marble polished, of inexpressible beauty, as is the
front adorned with sculpture and rare statues. In the
middle is a stately cupola and two columns of sundry
streaked colored marble. About the body of the church,
on a cornice within, are inserted the heads of all the Popes.
The pulpit is beautified with marble figures, a piece of
exquisite work; but what exceeds all description is the
pavement, where (besides the various emblems and other
figures in the nave) the choir is wrought with the history
of the Bible, so artificially expressed in the natural colors
of the marbles, that few pictures exceed it. Here stands
a Christo, rarely cut in marble, and on the large high altar is
a brazen vessel of admirable invention and art. The organs
are exceeding sweet and well tuned. On the left side of
the altar is the library, where are painted the acts of
Æneas Sylvius, and others by Raphael. They showed us
an arm of St. John the Baptist, wherewith, they say, he
baptized our Savior in Jordan; it was given by the King
of Peloponnesus to one of the Popes, as an inscription
testifies. They have also St. Peter's sword, with which
he smote off the ear of Malchus.</p>

<p>Just against the cathedral, we went into the Hospital,
where they entertain and refresh for three or four days,
gratis, such pilgrims as go to Rome. In the chapel belonging
to it lies the body of St. Susorius, their founder,
as yet uncorrupted, though dead many hundreds of years.
They show one of the nails which pierced our Savior, and
Saint Chrysostom's "Comment on the Gospel," written by
his own hand. Below the hill stands the pool called
Fonte Brande, where fish are fed for pleasure more than
food.</p>

<p>St. Francis's Church is a large pile, near which, yet a
little without the city, grows a tree which they report in
their legend grew from the Saint's staff, which, on going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to sleep, he fixed in the ground, and at his waking found
it had grown a large tree. They affirm that the wood of
it in decoction cures sundry diseases.</p>
