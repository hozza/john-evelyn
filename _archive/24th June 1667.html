<p>The Dutch fleet still continuing to
stop up the river, so as nothing could stir out or come in,
I was before the Council, and commanded by his Majesty
to go with some others and search about the environs of
the city, now exceedingly distressed for want of fuel,
whether there could be any peat, or turf, found fit for use.
The next day, I went and discovered enough, and made
my report that there might be found a great deal; but
nothing further was done in it.</p>
