of the Prince of Orange, but no certainty. Reports of
his great losses of horse in the storm, but without any
assurance. A man was taken with divers papers and
printed manifestoes, and carried to Newgate, after examination
at the Cabinet Council. There was likewise a
declaration of the States for satisfaction of all public
ministers at The Hague, except to the English and the
French. There was in that of the Prince's an expression,
as if the Lords both spiritual and temporal had invited
him over, with a deduction of the causes of his
enterprise. This made his Majesty convene my Lord of
Canterbury and the other Bishops now in town, to give
an account of what was in the manifesto, and to enjoin
them to clear themselves by some public writing of this
disloyal charge.</p>
