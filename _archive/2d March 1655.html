<p>Mr.Â Simpson, the King's jeweler,
showed me a most rich agate cup, of an escalop-shape, and
having a figure of Cleopatra at the scroll, her body, hair,
mantle, and veil, of the several natural colors. It was
supported by a half Mark Antony, the colors rarely
natural, and the work truly antique, but I conceived
they were of several pieces; had they been all of one
stone, it were invaluable.</p>
