<p>No sermon this afternoon, which I
think did not happen twice in this parish these thirty
years; so gracious has God been to it, and indeed to the
whole nation: God grant that we abuse not this great
privilege either by our wantonness, schism, or unfaithfulness,
under such means as he has not favored any other
nation under Heaven besides!</p>
