<p>Saw a triumph in Monsieur del
Camp's Academy, where divers of the French and English
noblesse, especially my Lord of Ossory, and Richard,
sons to the Marquis of Ormond (afterward Duke), did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
their exercises on horseback in noble equipage, before a
world of spectators and great persons, men and ladies.
It ended in a collation.</p>
