<p>The Trinity Company met this day,
which should have been on the Monday after Trinity,
but was put off by reason of the Royal Charter being
so large, that it could not be ready before. Some immunities
were superadded. Mr. Pepys, Secretary to the
Admiralty, was a second time chosen Master. There
were present the Duke of Grafton, Lord Dartmouth,
Master of the Ordnance, the Commissioners of the Navy,
and Brethren of the Corporation. We went to church,
according to custom, and then took barge to the Trinity
House, in London, where we had a great dinner, above
eighty at one table.</p>
