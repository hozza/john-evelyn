<p>I took coach and went to see the
famous Jardine Royale, which is an inclosure walled in,
consisting of all varieties of ground for planting and culture
of medical simples. It is well chosen, having in it
hills, meadows, wood and upland, natural and artificial,
and is richly stored with exotic plants. In the middle of
the parterre is a fair fountain. There is a very fine
house, chapel, laboratory, orangery, and other accommodations
for the President, who is always one of the
king's chief physicians.</p>

<p>From hence, we went to the other side of the town,
and to some distance from it, to the Bois de Vincennes,
going by the Bastille, which is the fortress, tower, and
magazine of this great city. It is very spacious within,
and there the Grand Master of the artillery has his
house, with fair gardens and walks.</p>

<p>The Bois de Vincennes has in it a square and noble
castle, with magnificent apartments, fit for a royal court,
not forgetting the chapel. It is the chief prison for persons
of quality. About it there is a park walled in, full
of deer; and in one part there is a grove of goodly pine trees.</p>

<p>The next day, I went to see the Louvre with more
attention, its several courts and pavilions. One of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the quadrangles, begun by Henry IV., and finished
by his son and grandson, is a superb, but mixed structure.
The cornices, moldings, and compartments, with
the insertion of several colored marbles, have been of
great expense.</p>

<p>We went through the long gallery, paved with white
and black marble, richly fretted and painted <i>Ã  fresco</i>.
The front looking to the river, though of rare work for
the carving, yet wants of that magnificence which a
plainer and truer design would have contributed to it.</p>

<p>In the Cour aux Tuileries is a princely fabric; the
winding geometrical stone stairs, with the cupola, I take
to be as bold and noble a piece of architecture as any
in Europe of the kind. To this is a <i>corps de logis</i>, worthy
of so great a prince. Under these buildings, through a
garden in which is an ample fountain, was the king's
printing house, and that famous letter so much esteemed.
Here I bought divers of the classic authors, poets, and
others.</p>

<p>We returned through another gallery, larger, but not
so long, where hung the pictures of all the kings and
queens and prime nobility of France.</p>

<p>Descending hence, we were let into a lower very large
room, called the <i>Salle des Antiques</i>, which is a vaulted
Cimelia, destined for statues only, among which stands
that so celebrated Diana of the Ephesians, said to be the
same which uttered oracles in that renowned Temple.
Besides these colossean figures of marble, I must not
forget the huge globe suspended by chains. The pavings,
inlayings, and incrustations of this Hall, are very
rich.</p>

<p>In another more private garden toward the Queen's
apartment is a walk, or cloister, under arches, whose terrace
is paved with stones of a great breadth; it looks
toward the river, and has a pleasant aviary, fountain,
stately cypresses, etc. On the river are seen a prodigious
number of barges and boats of great length, full of hay,
corn, wood, wine, and other commodities, which this vast
city daily consumes. Under the long gallery we have
described, dwell goldsmiths, painters, statuaries, and
architects, who being the most famous for their art in
Christendom have stipends allowed them by the King.
Into that of Monsieur Saracin we entered, who was then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
molding for an image of a Madonna to be cast in gold
of a great size to be sent by the Queen Regent to
Loretto, as an offering for the birth of the Dauphin, now
the young King.</p>

<p>I finished this day with a walk in the great garden of
the Tuileries, rarely contrived for privacy, shade, or
company, by groves, plantations of tall trees, especially
that in the middle, being of elms, the other of mulberries;
and that labyrinth of cypresses; not omitting the noble
hedges of pomegranates, fountains, fish-ponds, and an
aviary; but, above all, the artificial echo, redoubling the
words so distinctly; and, as it is never without some fair
nymph singing to its grateful returns; standing at one of
the focuses, which is under a tree or little cabinet of
hedges, the voice seems to descend from the clouds; at
another, as if it was underground. This being at the
bottom of the garden, we were let into another, which
being kept with all imaginary accurateness as to the
orangery, precious shrubs, and rare fruits, seemed a Paradise.
From a terrace in this place we saw so many
coaches, as one would hardly think could be maintained
in the whole city, going, late as it was in the year,
toward the course, which is a place adjoining, of near an
English mile long, planted with four rows of trees, making
a large circle in the middle. This course is walled
about, near breast high, with squared freestone, and has a
stately arch at the entrance, with sculpture and statues
about it, built by Mary di Medicis. Here it is that the
gallants and ladies of the Court take the air and divert
themselves, as with us in Hyde Park, the circle being
capable of containing a hundred coaches to turn commodiously,
and the larger of the plantations for five or six
coaches abreast.</p>

<p>Returning through the Tuileries, we saw a building in
which are kept wild beasts for the King's pleasure, a
bear, a wolf, a wild boar, a leopard, etc.</p>
