<p>I went to see a dromedary, a
very monstrous beast, much like the camel, but larger.
There was also dancing on the rope; but, above all, surprising
to those who were ignorant of the address, was
the water-spouter, who, drinking only fountain-water,
rendered out of his mouth in several glasses all sorts of
wine and sweet waters. For a piece of money he discovered
the secret to me. I waited on Friar Nicholas at
the convent at Chaillot, who, being an excellent chemist,
showed me his laboratory, and rare collection of spagyrical
remedies. He was both physician and apothecary of
the convent, and, instead of the names of his drugs, he
painted his boxes and pots with the figure of the drug,
or simple, contained in them. He showed me as a rarity
some ☿ of antimony. He had cured Monsieur Senatin of
a desperate sickness, for which there was building a
monumental altar that was to cost £1,500.</p>
